# golines
Golines is a golang formatter that shortens long lines, in addition to all
of the formatting fixes done by [`gofmt`](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/).

## Motivation

The standard golang formatting tools (`gofmt`, `goimports`, etc.) are great, but
[deliberately don't shorten long lines](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11915); instead, this
is an activity left to developers.

While there are different tastes when it comes to line lengths in go, we've generally found
that very long lines are more difficult to read than their shortened alternatives. As an example:

```go
myMap := map[string]string{"first key": "first value", "second key": "second value", "third key": "third value", "fourth key": "fourth value", "fifth key": "fifth value"}
...
