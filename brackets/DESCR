Welcome to Brackets! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets)
-------------------

Brackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS
and JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?

* **Tools shouldn't get in your way.** Instead of cluttering up your coding
environment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts 
context-specific code and tools inline.
* **Brackets is in sync with your browser.** With Live Preview, Brackets
works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump
back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.
* **Do it yourself.** Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, you can [help build](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) the best code editor for the web.

Brackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard) that we're anxious to add and other
innovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets.
