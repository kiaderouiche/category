LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop
integrals based on the FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh. It features
an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the scalar one-loop
functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-, and 4-point tensor
coefficient functions.
