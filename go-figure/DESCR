# Go Figure

## Description
Go Figure prints beautiful ASCII art from text.
It supports [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/) files,

This package was inspired by the Ruby gem [artii](https://github.com/miketierney/artii),
but built from scratch and with a different feature set.

## Installation
`go get github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure`

## Basic Example
```go
package main

import("github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure")
...
