A Go (golang) port of the Ruby dotenv project (which loads env vars from a .env file)

From the original Library:

> Storing configuration in the environment is one of the tenets of a twelve-factor app. Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments–such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services–should be extracted from the code into environment variables.
>
> But it is not always practical to set environment variables on development machines or continuous integration servers where multiple projects are run. Dotenv load variables from a .env file into ENV when the environment is bootstrapped.

It can be used as a library (for loading in env for your own daemons etc) or as a bin command.

There is test coverage and CI for both linuxish and windows environments, but I make no guarantees about the bin version working on windows.

## Installation

As a library

```shell
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
...
