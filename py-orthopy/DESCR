orthopy provides various orthogonal polynomial classes for lines, triangles,
disks, spheres, n-cubes, the nD space with weight function exp(-r2)
and more. All computations are done using numerically stable recurrence
schemes. Furthermore, all functions are fully vectorized and can return
results in exact arithmetic
