QNotifications brings pretty in-app notifications to PyQt. We are used to seeing
such notifications in many web applications nowadays (as an example, see sAlert),
but functionality like this was still lacking in PyQt. QNotifications aims to
provide a system that can display several types of notifications (info, errors,
warnings, etc.) and can easily be plugged into existing PyQt projects. To integrate
this module into existing applications just pass it a widget on which it should
render the notifications.

I designed this system with the Gnome UI guidlines for in-app notifications in mind. However, I do deviate from them at some points. For example, QNotifications currently
allows multiple notifications to be displayed simultaneously (they will be stacked
on top of each other), while best practice is to display multiple notifications sequentially but only one a the time. Additionally, QNotifications currently does
not offer the possibility to display a button to undertake an action inside a
notification
