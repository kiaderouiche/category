# pybadges

pybadges is a Python library and command line tool that allows you to create
Github-style badges as SVG images. For example:

![pip installation](tests/golden-images/pip.svg)
![pip installation](tests/golden-images/license.svg)
![pip installation](tests/golden-images/build-passing.svg)

The aesthetics of the generated badges matches the  visual design found in this
[specification](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/SPECIFICATION.md).

The implementation of the library was heavily influenced by
[Shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) and the JavaScript
[gh-badges](https://github.com/badges/shields#using-the-badge-library) library.
