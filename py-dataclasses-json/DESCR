# Dataclasses JSON

![](https://github.com/lidatong/dataclasses-json/workflows/dataclasses-json/badge.svg)

This library provides a simple API for encoding and decoding [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) to and from JSON.

It's very easy to get started.

[README / Documentation website](https://lidatong.github.io/dataclasses-json). Features a navigation bar and search functionality, and should mirror this README exactly -- take a look!

## Quickstart

`pip install dataclasses-json`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

@dataclass_json
@dataclass
...
