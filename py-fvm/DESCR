Creating finite volume equation systems with ease.

pyfvm provides everything that is needed for setting up finite volume equation systems.
The user needs to specify the finite volume formulation in a configuration file, and
pyfvm will create the matrix/right-hand side or the nonlinear system for it. This
package is for everyone who wants to quickly construct FVM systems.
