[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gotk3/gotk3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gotk3/gotk3)

The gotk3 project provides Go bindings for GTK 3 and dependent
projects.  Each component is given its own subdirectory, which is used
as the import path for the package.  Partial binding support for the
following libraries is currently implemented:

- GTK 3 (3.12 and later)
- GDK 3 (3.12 and later)
- GLib 2 (2.36 and later)
- Cairo (1.10 and later)

Care has been taken for memory management to work seamlessly with Go's
garbage collector without the need to use or understand GObject's
floating references.
