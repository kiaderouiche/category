Docker Interface (DI) is a declarative interface for building images and running commands in containers using Docker. At Spotify, we use Docker Interface to minimise environment drift by running all of our code in containersâ€“during development, production, or to train machine learning models.

## Installing Docker Interface

You can install Docker Interface using the following `pip` command (you need a python3 interpreter).

```
pip install docker-interface
```

To check that Docker Interface was installed successfully, run
```
di --help
```
