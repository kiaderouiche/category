# `tupu` - Fast geodesic distances in Python

This is a **personal project** centered around geodesic distances.
Its goal is to be able to quickly compute, for every coordinate in a list:

- Distances to a given point (e.g. distances from each point to NYC)
- Nearest neighbors: distances to the closest point in another list (e.g. distances from each point to a city), and the identity of such point
- Number of neighbors: number of points of another list within a certain distance or buffer.


## Dev Install

After cloning the repo and opening the panflute folder:

`python setup.py install`
: installs the package locally

`python setup.py develop`
: installs locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated
