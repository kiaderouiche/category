======

GoMock is a mocking framework for the [Go programming language][golang]. It
integrates well with Go's built-in `testing` package, but can be used in other
contexts too.

Installation
------------

Once you have [installed Go][golang-install], install the `mockgen` tool.

To get the latest released version use:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@latest
```

If you use `mockgen` in your CI pipeline, it may be more appropriate to fixate
on a specific mockgen version.
