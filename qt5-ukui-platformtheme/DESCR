# qt5-ukui-platformtheme
The UKUI platform theme for qt5 QPA.

## Document
See [doxygen/README.md](doxygen/README.md).

## Description
In the early development of the UKUI 3.0, we used qt5-gtk2-platformtheme to ensure the unity of the UKUI desktop style. However, it has many limitations for our new desgin.

This project is intend to provide a common resolution of desktop application development with qt5 in UKUI3.0. We hope provide a platform theme to unify and beautify all qt applications according to the design of UKUI3.0, not only our own applications. We are also committed to building our applications that can adapt to different styles. This project is first step to archive those objectives.

qt5-ukui-platformtheme's route brings us closer to the upstream communities. It is not a division, but a desire for fusion and individuality in a compatible way.
