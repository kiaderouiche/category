Go parallel gzip compression/decompression. This is a fully gzip
compatible drop in replacement for "compress/gzip". This will split
compression into blocks that are compressed in parallel. This can
be useful for compressing big amounts of data. The gzip decompression
is modified so it decompresses ahead of the current reader. This means
that reads will be non-blocking if the decompressor can keep ahead of your
code reading from it. CRC calculation also takes place in a separate goroutine.
