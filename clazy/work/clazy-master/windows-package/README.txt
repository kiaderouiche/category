This package distributes the clang compiler and a compiler plugin called clazy.
clang and llvm were built from branch release_90 (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm.git 5364ee5faec778f1ddf86b6b4b8452df7db191c5 and https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang.git 45898f3be1d37727502cd6342b14c19e7c94bfae).

See LICENSE-LLVM.TXT for clang's license.
See LICENSE-CLAZY.txt for clazy's license.
See README-CLAZY.md for more information and for how you can build clang and clazy to get these binaries yourself.
