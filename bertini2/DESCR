### Important note on cloning

The recommended method for getting the code for Bertini 2 is to clone from command line using git:

`git clone https://github.com/bertiniteam/b2 --recursive`

This ensures that any other repo's we depend on get cloned into their correct locations.  We have at least one for the Python bindings -- [MiniEigen](https://github.com/eudoxos/minieigen).
