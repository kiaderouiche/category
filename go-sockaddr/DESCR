## `sockaddr` Library

Socket address convenience functions for Go.  `go-sockaddr` is a convenience
library that makes doing the right thing with IP addresses easy.  `go-sockaddr`
is loosely modeled after the UNIX `sockaddr_t` and creates a union of the family
of `sockaddr_t` types (see below for an ascii diagram).  Library documentation
is available
at
[https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr).
The primary intent of the library was to make it possible to define heuristics
for selecting the correct IP addresses when a configuration is evaluated at
runtime.  See
the
[docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr),
[`template` package](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-sockaddr/template),
tests,
and
