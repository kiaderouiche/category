The aspcud project provides the converter/preprocessor `cudf2lp`
to translate a CUDF specification into a set of facts. These facts
together with an encoding can then be passed to an ASP grounder and
solver to solve the package problem. The small C program `aspcud` 
takes care of this, calling the necessary tools and printing the result
in CUDF format.
