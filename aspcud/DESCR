Aspcud - A solver for package problems in CUDF format using ASP
---------------------------------------------------------------

The aspcud project provides the converter/preprocessor `cudf2lp` to translate a
CUDF specification into a set of facts. These facts together with an encoding
can then be passed to an ASP grounder and solver to solve the package problem.
The small C program `aspcud` takes care of this, calling the necessary tools
and printing the result in CUDF format.

To run aspcud, use the installed aspcud binary (take a look at the examples
folder to get started):

    aspcud problem.cudf solution.cudf <criteria>

For this to work, clasp and gringo have to be installed.  Solver and grounder
are available at:
