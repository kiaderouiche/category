clasp is an answer set solver for (extended) normal and disjunctive logic
programs. It is part of the [Potassco](https://potassco.org) project for
*Answer Set Programming* (ASP). The primary algorithm of clasp relies on
conflict-driven nogood learning, a technique that proved very successful
for satisfiability checking (SAT). clasp has been genuinely developed for
answer set solving but can also be applied as a (Max-)SAT or PB solver or
as a C++ library in another program.
