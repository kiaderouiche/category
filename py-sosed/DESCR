# *Sosed*, similar projects search

An embedding-based approach to detect similar software projects.

## *Sosed*'s history

Initially, we created a novel approach to represent code as a part of a source code topic modeling project (not finished yet).
On the way, we found out that with the new representation, we can explicitly measure  the distance between arbitrary pieces of code (and even projects!),
and at the project level it works reasonably well.
We decided to implement it as a stand-alone tool to verify the feasibility of our approach and share it with the community.

Also, *Sosed* means "neighbor" in Russian.
