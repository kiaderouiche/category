The goal of this project is to provide full support of the [GraphQL draft specification](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft) with a set of idiomatic, easy to use Go packages.

While still under heavy development (`internal` APIs are almost certainly subject to change), this library is
safe for production use.

## Features

- minimal API
- support for `context.Context`
- support for the `OpenTracing` standard
- schema type-checking against resolvers
- resolvers are matched to the schema based on method sets (can resolve a GraphQL schema with a Go interface or Go struct).
- handles panics in resolvers
- parallel execution of resolvers
- subscriptions
   - [sample WS transport](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-transport-ws)
