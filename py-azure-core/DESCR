# Azure Core shared client library for Python

Azure core provides shared exceptions and modules for Python SDK client libraries. 
These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_introduction.html) .

If you are a client library developer, please reference [client library developer reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md) for more information.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/) | [Package (Pypi)][package] | [API reference documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/)

## Getting started

Typically, you will not need to install azure core; 
it will be installed when you install one of the client libraries using it. 
In case you want to install it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example), 
you can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/).
