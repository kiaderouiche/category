## Purpose

[Flutter](http://flutter.io/) allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.

This [unofficial](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues/191#issuecomment-511384007) project brings Flutter to the desktop through the power of [Go](http://golang.org/) and [GLFW](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw).

The flutter engine itself doesn't know how to deal with desktop platforms _(eg handling mouse/keyboard input)_. Instead, it exposes an abstraction layer for whatever platform to implement. This project implements the [Flutter's Embedding API](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders) using a single code base that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For rendering, [**GLFW**](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) fits the job because it provides the right abstractions over the OpenGL's Buffer/Mouse/Keyboard for each platform. 

The choice of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) comes from the fact that it has the same tooling on every platform. Plus Golang is a great language because it keeps everything simple and readable, which makes it easy to build cross-platform plugins.
