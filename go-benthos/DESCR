Benthos is a high performance and resilient stream processor, able to connect various [sources][inputs] and [sinks][outputs] in a range of brokering patterns and perform [hydration, enrichments, transformations and filters][processors] on payloads.

It comes with a [powerful mapping language][bloblang-about], is easy to deploy and monitor, and ready to drop into your pipeline either as a static binary, docker image, or [serverless function][serverless].

Stream pipelines are defined in a single config file, allowing you to declare
connectors and a list of processing stages:

```yaml
input:
  gcp_pubsub:
    project: foo
    subscription: bar

pipeline:
...
