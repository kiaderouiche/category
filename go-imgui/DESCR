This library is a [Go](https://www.golang.org) wrapper for **[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)**.

This wrapper started as a special-purpose wrapper for use within InkyBlackness.
However, it is self-contained and can be used for other purposes as well.

This wrapper is
* hand-crafted, for Go
* documented
* versioned
* with ported examples in a separate repository (see below)
