			<ol>
			<li class="list"><b>Projects</b> are containers for your Test Cases and Test Suites. 
			They also contain information about your application under test (AUT), including
			how and where to start it. 
			<br>
			Projects are stored in a database, and can also be exported and imported in
			XML format.
			</li>
			
			<li class="list"><b>Test Suites</b> are the executable elements. 
			Fill your Test Suites with the Test Cases you want to execute. 
			<br>
			Test Suites are bound to an AUT. 
			</li>
			
			<li class="list"><b>Test Jobs</b> are collections of Test Suites. 
			A Test Job can be used to test different instances of the same AUT, 
			or different AUTs within one test run.  
			<br>
			Test Jobs are bound to an AUT via its ID. 
			</li>
			
			
			<li class="list"><b>Test Cases</b> are the building blocks (keywords) for your tests. 
			They can contain Test Steps and other Test Cases. 
			<br>
			Combine Test Cases to create larger, more complex Test Cases. 
			</li>
		
			<li class="list"><b>Test Steps</b> are the smallest available units. 
			Each Test Step contains three pieces of information:
			<br>
			<ol>
			<li class="list">The component to be tested in the interface</li>
			<li class="list">The action to execute on the component</li>
			<li class="list">The data (or parameters) for the action</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			You also enter a <i>component name</i>, which is your own name for this 
			interface component. This name is joined to the real component name in the 
			AUT later.  
			</li>
			
			<li class="list">Most of the time, you will not be working with Test Steps, but with 
			the library of unbound modules, which contains ready made Test Cases to reference in
			your tests. Each unbound module represents one Test Step to carry out a particular action. The library 
			makes test creation easier by allowing you to drag and drop modules to create your Test Cases. 
			</li>
