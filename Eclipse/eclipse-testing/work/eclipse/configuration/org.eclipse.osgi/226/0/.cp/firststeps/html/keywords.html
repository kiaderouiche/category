				Tests through the GUI (black box tests) are made up of many repeated actions, such as entering or checking text, 
				clicking buttons, etc.  
				</p>
			
				<p class="maintxt">
				If you write a new Test Case for each click or sequence, test maintenance will be a nightmare. 
				To avoid redundancy in your tests, (and to make maintenance more easy) we support 
				wide reusability of Test Cases by letting you reference the Test Cases you have created. 
				</p>
		
				<p class="maintxt">
				Use our library of Test Cases (the unbound modules) to get started. Simply reference the Test Cases you want 
				to use from this library to create your own Test Cases.    
				</p>
				
				<p class="maintxt">
				Give your Test Cases meaningful names (keywords) so that your tests are easy to read and understand.   
				</p>
				
				<p class="maintxt">
				Think about structure - which data or component names can you set in a Test Case because they will not change? 
				Which data or component names should you parameterize so that you can change them each time you reference a 
				Test Case?  
				</p>
				
				<p class="maintxt">
				Create keywords for actions or sequences that you need to carry out frequently. If you are specifying something for the 
				second time, think about refactoring your test to create a keyword to do the action / sequence, and reference it each time you 
				need it instead.  
				</p>
				
				<p class="maintxt">
				The more you reuse, the easier it is to keep your tests up to date!
