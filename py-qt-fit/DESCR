PyQt-Fit
========

PyQt-Fit is a regression toolbox in Python with simple GUI and graphical tools
to check your results. It currently handles regression based on user-defined
functions with user-defined residuals (i.e. parametric regression) or
non-parametric regression, either local-constant or local-polynomial, with the
option to provide your own. There is also a full-GUI access, that currently
provides an interface only to parametric regression.

The GUI for 1D data analysis is invoked with:

    $ pyqt_fit1d.py

PyQt-Fit can also be used from the python interpreter. Here is a typical session:

    >>> import pyqt_fit
    >>> from pyqt_fit import plot_fit
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from matplotlib import pylab
...
