Read http://owaislone.org/blog/webpack-plus-reactjs-and-django/ for a detailed step by step guide on setting up webpack with django using this library.


Use webpack to generate your static bundles without django's staticfiles or opaque wrappers.


Django webpack loader consumes the output generated by [webpack-bundle-tracker](https://github.com/owais/webpack-bundle-tracker) and lets you use the generated bundles in django.

A [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is also available.
