Hatchet is a Python-based library that allows dataframes to be indexed by
structured tree and graph data. It is intended for analyzing performance data
that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent
calling context trees, call graphs, nested regionsâ€™ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements
various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple
data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.
