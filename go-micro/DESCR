Go Micro is a framework for distributed systems development.

## Overview

Go Micro provides the core requirements for distributed systems development including RPC and Event driven communication. 
The **Micro** philosophy is sane defaults with a pluggable architecture. We provide defaults to get you started quickly 
but everything can be easily swapped out. 

## Features

Go Micro abstracts away the details of distributed systems. Here are the main features.

- **Authentication** - Auth is built in as a first class citizen. Authentication and authorization enable secure 
zero trust networking by providing every service an identity and certificates. This additionally includes rule 
based access control.

- **Dynamic Config** - Load and hot reload dynamic config from anywhere. The config interface provides a way to load application 
level config from any source such as env vars, file, etcd. You can merge the sources and even define fallbacks.
