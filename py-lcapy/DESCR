Lcapy is a Python package for linear circuit analysis.  It uses SymPy
for symbolic mathematics.

Lcapy can analyse circuits described with netlists or by series/parallel combinations of components.

Circuit analysis
----------------

The circuit is described using netlists, similar to SPICE, with
arbitrary node names (except for the ground node which is labelled 0).
The netlists can be loaded from a file or created at run-time.  For
example:

    >>> from lcapy import Circuit, s
...
