 STRINGS is a Monte Carlo event generator
 for the production and decay of first and
 second string resonances in proton-proton
 collisions. This generator is also capable
 of producing QCD di-parton processes. STRINGS
 can be interfaced to common hadronization
 programs using the Les Houches Accord
