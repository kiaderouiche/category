# SWH Tarball Loader

The Software Heritage Tarball Loader is in charge of ingesting the directory
representation of the tarball into the Software Heritage archive.

## Sample configuration

The loader's configuration will be taken from the default configuration file:
`~/.config/swh/loader/tar.yml` (you can choose a different path by setting the
`SWH_CONFIG_FILENAME` environment variable).

This file holds information for the loader to work, including celery
configuration:

```YAML
working_dir: /home/storage/tmp/
storage:
  cls: remote
  args:
    url: http://localhost:5002/
...
