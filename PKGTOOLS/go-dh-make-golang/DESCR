[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Debian/dh-make-golang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Debian/dh-make-golang)

dh-make-golang is a tool to automatically create Debian packaging for Go
packages. Its goal is to automate away as much of the work as possible when
creating a Debian package for a Go library package or Go program.

## Overview

All you need to specify is a Go package name. In your current working
directory, a new directory will be created containing a git repository. Inside
that repository, you’ll find the Go package’s source code plus the necessary
Debian packaging files to build a Debian package. The packaging adheres to the
[pkg-go packaging guidelines](https://go-team.pages.debian.net/packaging.html)
and hence can be placed alongside the other [team-maintained packages in
pkg-go](https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages), hosted on Debian’s
[salsa](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa).
