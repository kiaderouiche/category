## Usage

The procfs library is organized by packages based on whether the gathered data is coming from
/proc, /sys, or both.  Each package contains an `FS` type which represents the path to either /proc, 
/sys, or both.  For example, cpu statistics are gathered from
`/proc/stat` and are available via the root procfs package.  First, the proc filesystem mount
point is initialized, and then the stat information is read.
