Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that
possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and
parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for
Python/numpy. It is developed by Facebook AI Research
