## Trio guest mode wrapper for PyGTK

Using the [Trio guest mode](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-lowlevel.html#using-guest-mode-to-run-trio-on-top-of-other-event-loops) feature, we can run both the Trio and PyGTK event loops alongside each other in a single program. This allows us to make use of the Trio library and the usual `async`/`await` syntax and not have to directly manage thread pools. This library provides a thin wrapper for initialising the guest mode and exposes a single public API function, `trio_gtk.run` into which you can pass your Trio main function.

## Install

```sh
$ pip install trio-gtk
```

Please note, `trio-gtk` does install [pygobject](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject) directly as a Python package. We use relaxed bounds to ensure that the hard dependency on system packages (see [cairo integration documentation](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/cairo_integration.html) will not stop you having a successful installation. This may not always work out. If you see a build error during your Pip installation, please raise a ticket and we will see what we can do.

## Example

```python
import gi
