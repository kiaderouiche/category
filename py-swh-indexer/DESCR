swh-indexer
============

Tools to compute multiple indexes on SWH's raw contents:
- content:
  - mimetype
  - ctags
  - language
  - fossology-license
  - metadata
- revision:
  - metadata

An indexer is in charge of:
- looking up objects
- extracting information from those objects
- store those information in the swh-indexer db

There are multiple indexers working on different object types:
  - content indexer: works with content sha1 hashes
