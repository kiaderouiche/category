Installs a WSGI application in place of a real host for testing.

Introduction
============

Testing a WSGI application sometimes involves starting a server at a
local host and port, then pointing your test code to that address.
Instead, this library lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port
combination and redirect them into a `WSGI application`_ importable by
your test program. Thus, you can avoid spawning multiple processes or
threads to test your Web app.

Supported Libaries
==================

``wsgi_intercept`` works with a variety of HTTP clients in Python 2.7,
3.5 and beyond, and in pypy.

* urllib2
* urllib.request
