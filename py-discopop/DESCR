# DiscoPoP - Discovery of Potential Parallelism
DiscoPoP is an open-source tool that helps software developers parallelize their programs with threads. It is a joint project of Technical University of Darmstadt and Iowa State University. 

In a nutshell, DiscoPoP performs the following steps:
* detect parts of the code (computational units or CUs) with little to no internal parallelization potential,
* find data dependences among them,
* identify parallel patterns that can be used to parallelize a code region,
* and finally suggest corresponding OpenMP parallelization constructs and clauses to programmers.

DiscoPoP is built on top of LLVM. Therefore, DiscoPoP can perform the above-mentioned steps on any source code which can be transferred into the LLVM IR.

A more comprehensive overview of DiscoPoP can be found on our [project website](http://www.discopop.org/).

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites
Before doing anything, you need a basic development setup. We have tested DiscoPoP on Ubuntu, and the prerequisite packages should be installed using the following command:

	sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake

Additionally, you need to install LLVM on your system. Currently, DiscoPoP only supports LLVM 8.0. Due to API changes, which lead to compilation failures, it does not support lower and higher versions. Please follow the [installation tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html), if you have not installed LLVM yet.
