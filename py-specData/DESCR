Object-oriented Python package for processing spectral data
or in general, n-dimensional data with labeled axes (i.e.
N-dimensional gridded data or "nddata"). It depends on numpy,
which provides very fast manipulations of N-dimensional gridded
arrays ("ndarray"). This package has some overlap with xarray,
but it doesn't attempt to mimic pandas notation, shooting
instead for very compact notation for natural slicing, etc.
It mainly focuses on making it easier to quickly write good
code for processing spectroscopy data. In particular, it takes
care of various features related to fourier transformation,
error propagation, and direct products in multidimensional
data with little to no interaction from the user
