SUMMARY
-------
This program provides a SUSY spectrum in the NMSSM, or the MSSM including
flavour violation and with or without R-parity consistent with input Standard
Model fermion mass/mixings and electroweak/strong coupling data. The R-parity
violating mode can calculate neutrino masses and mixings to 1 loop. SOFTSUSY
can be used in conjunction with other programs for many different particle
physics calculations. SOFTSUSY now has a mode with 3 loop RGEs and some 2-loop
threshold corrections.
