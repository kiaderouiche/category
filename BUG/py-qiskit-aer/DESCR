Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum
computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that each work together to enable
quantum computing. This element is Aer, which provides
high-performance quantum computing simulators with realistic
noise models
