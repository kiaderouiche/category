swiglpk is not a high-level wrapper for GLPK (take a look at optlang if you
are interested in a python-based mathematical programming language). It just
provides plain vanilla swig bindings to the underlying C library. In constrast
to other GLPK wrappers for python (e.g. PyGLPK, Python-GLPK, ctypes-glpk,
ecyglpki etc.) it is fairly version agnostic: it will try to guess the location
of the glpk.h header file (using which glpsol) and then compile the extension
for your particular GLPK installation. Furthermore, swiglpk provides binary wheels
for all major platforms.
