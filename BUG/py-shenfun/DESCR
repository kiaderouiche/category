Shenfun is a high performance computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by the spectral Galerkin method. The user
interface to shenfun is very similar to `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>,
but applications are limited to multidimensional tensor product grids,
using either Cartesian or curvilinear grids (e.g., but not limited to,
polar, cylindrical, spherical or parabolic). The code is parallelized
with MPI through the `mpi4py-fft <https://bitbucket.org/ mpi4py/mpi4py-fft>`_ 
package.
