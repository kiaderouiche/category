Gota: DataFrames, Series and Data Wrangling for Go
==================================================

This is an implementation of DataFrames, Series and data wrangling
methods for the Go programming language. The API is still in flux so
*use at your own risk*.

DataFrame
---------

The term DataFrame typically refers to a tabular dataset that can be
viewed as a two dimensional table. Often the columns of this dataset
refers to a list of features, while the rows represent a number of
measurements. As the data on the real world is not perfect, DataFrame
supports non measurements or NaN elements.

Common examples of DataFrames can be found on Excel sheets, CSV files
or SQL database tables, but this data can come on a variety of other
formats, like a collection of JSON objects or XML files.
