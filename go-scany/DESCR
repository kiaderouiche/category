## Overview

Go favors simplicity, and it's pretty common to work with a database via driver directly without any ORM.
It provides great control and efficiency in your queries, but here is a problem: 
you need to manually iterate over database rows and scan data from all columns into a corresponding destination.
It can be error-prone verbose and just tedious. 
scany aims to solve this problem, 
it allows developers to scan complex data from a database into Go structs and other composite types 
with just one function call and don't bother with rows iteration.

scany isn't limited to any specific database. It integrates with `database/sql`, 
so any database with `database/sql` driver is supported.
