# makezero

makezero is a Go static analysis tool to find slice declarations that are not initialized with zero length and are later
used with append.

## Installation

    go get -u github.com/ashanbrown/makezero

## Usage

Similar to other Go static analysis tools (such as golint, go vet), makezero can be invoked with one or more filenames, directories, or packages named by its import path. makezero also supports the `...` wildcard.

    makezero [-always] packages...

### Flags

- **-always** (default false) - Always require slices to be initialized with zero length, regardless of whether they are used with append.
