## Motivations

We rely on both Go and Kafka a lot at Segment. Unfortunately, the state of the Go
client libraries for Kafka at the time of this writing was not ideal. The available
options were:

- [sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama), which is by far the most popular
but is quite difficult to work with. It is poorly documented, the API exposes
low level concepts of the Kafka protocol, and it doesn't support recent Go features
like [contexts](https://golang.org/pkg/context/). It also passes all values as
pointers which causes large numbers of dynamic memory allocations, more frequent
garbage collections, and higher memory usage.

- [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) is a
cgo based wrapper around [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka),
which means it introduces a dependency to a C library on all Go code that uses
the package. It has much better documentation than sarama but still lacks support
for Go contexts.
