Gabs is a small utility for dealing with dynamic or unknown JSON structures in Go. It's pretty much just a helpful wrapper for navigating hierarchies of `map[string]interface{}` objects provided by the `encoding/json` package. It does nothing spectacular apart from being fabulous.

If you're migrating from version 1 check out [`migration.md`][migration-doc] for guidance.
