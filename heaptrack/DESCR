# heaptrack - a heap memory profiler for Linux

![heaptrack_gui summary page](screenshots/gui_summary.png?raw=true "heaptrack_gui summary page")

Heaptrack traces all memory allocations and annotates these events with stack traces.
Dedicated analysis tools then allow you to interpret the heap memory profile to:

- find hotspots that need to be optimized to reduce the **memory footprint** of your application
- find **memory leaks**, i.e. locations that allocate memory which is never deallocated
- find **allocation hotspots**, i.e. code locations that trigger a lot of memory allocation calls
- find **temporary allocations**, which are allocations that are directly followed by their deallocation

## Using heaptrack

The recommended way is to launch your application and start tracing from the beginning:

    heaptrack <your application and its parameters>

    heaptrack output will be written to "/tmp/heaptrack.APP.PID.gz"
    starting application, this might take some time...
