# `ghw` - Golang HardWare discovery/inspection library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaypipes/ghw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaypipes/ghw)

<br /><br />
`ghw` is a small Golang library providing hardware inspection and discovery
for Linux and Windows. There currently exists partial support for MacOSX.

## Design Principles

* No root privileges needed for discovery

  `ghw` goes the extra mile to be useful without root priveleges. We query for
  host hardware information as directly as possible without relying on shellouts
  to programs like `dmidecode` that require root privileges to execute.

  Elevated privileges are indeed required to query for some information, but
  `ghw` will never error out if blocked from reading that information. Instead,
  `ghw` will print a warning message about the information that could not be
  retrieved. You may disable these warning messages with `GHW_DISABLE_WARNINGS`
  environment variable.
