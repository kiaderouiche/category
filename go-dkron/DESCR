# Dkron - Distributed, fault tolerant job scheduling system for cloud native environments [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/distribworks/dkron?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/distribworks/dkron) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/distribworks/dkron/actions) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/distribworks/dkron.svg)](https://gitter.im/distribworks/dkron)

Dkron is a distributed cron service, easy to setup and fault tolerant with focus in:

- Easy: Easy to use with a great UI
- Reliable: Completely fault tolerant
- High scalable: Able to handle high volumes of scheduled jobs and thousands of nodes

Dkron is written in Go and leverage the power of the Raft protocol and Serf for providing fault tolerance, reliability and scalability while keeping simple and easily installable.

Dkron is inspired by the google whitepaper [Reliable Cron across the Planet](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745840) and by Airbnb Chronos borrowing the same features from it.

Dkron runs on Linux, OSX and Windows. It can be used to run scheduled commands on a server cluster using any combination of servers for each job. It has no single points of failure due to the use of the Gossip protocol and fault tolerant distributed databases.
