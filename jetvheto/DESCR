           ********************************************

 This is JetVHeto, a program that performs NNLL resummation for
 jet-veto efficiencies and cross sections in Higgs and Z-boson
 production. It also carries out matching to fixed-order (up to NNNLO)
 results provided by the user. 

 The jets should be defined according to any longitudinally-invariant
 generalised kt algorithm (e.g. kt, anti-kt, C/A...), in the so-called
 "inclusive" mode, with E-scheme recombination and a a distance
 measure based on Delta y^2 + Delta phi^2.

 At NNLO and NNLL the resummed, fixed order and matched results are
 independent of whether the jet algorithm is kt, C/A or anti-kt (but
 do depend on the jet-radius R).
