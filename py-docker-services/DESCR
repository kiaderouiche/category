[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmonroy/docker-services.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmonroy/docker-services)

# Install

This project is available on pypi, so you can use _pip_ to install it:

```
pip install docker-services
```

Or include it as a dependency on `setup.py` or a `requirements.txt` file, whatever you prefer.


# Use it
