`go-hclog` is a package for Go that provides a simple key/value logging
interface for use in development and production environments.

It provides logging levels that provide decreased output based upon the
desired amount of output, unlike the standard library `log` package.

It provides `Printf` style logging of values via `hclog.Fmt()`.

It provides a human readable output mode for use in development as well as
JSON output mode for production.
