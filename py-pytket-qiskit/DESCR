# pytket-qiskit

[`pytket`](https://cqcl.github.io/pytket) is a Python module for interfacing
with CQC t|ket>, a set of quantum programming tools.

IBM's [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) is an open-source framework for quantum
computation, ranging from high-level algorithms to low-level circuit
representations, simulation and access to the [IBM Q
Experience](https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/) devices.

`pytket-qiskit` is an extension to `pytket` that allows `pytket` circuits to be
run on IBM backends and simulators, as well as conversion to and from Qiskit
representations.

## Getting started

`pytket-qiskit` is available for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, on Linux and MacOS. To
install, run:

```pip install pytket-qiskit```
