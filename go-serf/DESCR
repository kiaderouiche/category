Serf is a decentralized solution for service discovery and orchestration
that is lightweight, highly available, and fault tolerant.

Serf runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. An efficient and lightweight gossip
protocol is used to communicate with other nodes. Serf can detect node failures
and notify the rest of the cluster. An event system is built on top of
Serf, letting you use Serf's gossip protocol to propagate events such
as deploys, configuration changes, etc. Serf is completely masterless
with no single point of failure.

Here are some example use cases of Serf, though there are many others:

* Discovering web servers and automatically adding them to a load balancer
* Organizing many memcached or redis nodes into a cluster, perhaps with
