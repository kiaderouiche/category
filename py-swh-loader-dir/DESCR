SWH-loader-dir
===================

The Software Heritage Directory Loader is a tool and a library.

Its sole purpose is to walk a local directory and inject into the SWH
dataset all unknown contained files from that directory structure.


## Configuration

The loader needs a configuration file in *`{/etc/softwareheritage |
~/.config/swh | ~/.swh}`/loader/dir.yml*.

This file should be similar to this (adapt according to your needs):

``` yaml
storage:
  cls: remote
  args:
...
