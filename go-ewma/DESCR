This repo provides Exponentially Weighted Moving Average algorithms, or EWMAs for short, [based on our
Quantifying Abnormal Behavior talk](https://vividcortex.com/blog/2013/07/23/a-fast-go-library-for-exponential-moving-averages/).

### Exponentially Weighted Moving Average

An exponentially weighted moving average is a way to continuously compute a type of
average for a series of numbers, as the numbers arrive. After a value in the series is
added to the average, its weight in the average decreases exponentially over time. This
biases the average towards more recent data. EWMAs are useful for several reasons, chiefly
their inexpensive computational and memory cost, as well as the fact that they represent
the recent central tendency of the series of values.

The EWMA algorithm requires a decay factor, alpha. The larger the alpha, the more the average
is biased towards recent history. The alpha must be between 0 and 1, and is typically
...
