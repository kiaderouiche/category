== Introduction

Kraft is a Qt and KDE application to organize office documents like quotes and invoices in a small business. It eases the creation of these of documents and helps with repeating tasks.

With Kraft, there is no need for a text processor any more. Documents are created by a few clicks and archived automatically. Kraft generates high quality PDF output.

Feature Overview::

* Customer management, deeply integrated in the KDE infrastructure using KAddressbook.
* Automated creation of offers, invoices and similar documents.
* Templates for document header- and footertexts and for document items.
* Calculation of items.
* Material management.
* Configurable document creation in PDF format for print and email.

Kraft is designed to use the data entries from the KDE address book
which is a module of the https://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM[KDE PIM], an information management application.
All addresses are collected in the https://userbase.kde.org/KAddressBook[KAdressBook].

The code of Kraft is open source and is released under the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License[GNU General Public License].

NOTE: Kraft is driven by community of users, coders and others. +

== First Use and Basic Configuration

During the initial setup you are asked to select a database to use and give the address of your company.

You can fill in your company address (that appears on the printed documents) on two ways: use in the setup procedure the first tab Select from Addressbook for to select your on address in KAddressBook (if you have filled your own address in KaddressBook) or use the second tab Manual entry for to fill in the information of the address from your company by hand. This step is necessary for the correct generation of your documents.

After the initial setup, select menu:Preferences[Settings].
That allows to prepare Kraft correctly so it can be used in a useful way.

In the Preferences window we have the tabs:

 *Document Defaults
 *Taxes
 *Documunt Types
 *Wages
 *Units
 *Own identity

Each of the tabs allows to enter useful values for our use case.

=== Document Types

At the first use you find a list of different document types, such as:

* Acceptance of order
* Delivery receipt
* Invoice
* Offer

Translate this types to your own language.
You can also add new ones and remove document types you wont use.

==== Numbercycles

image:numbercycles.png[Numbercycles,float="right"]
Numbercycles are used to define the *document number* which is printed on every document.
The document number is an important unique identifier of the document and often must follow regulations.

Different document types can use the same number cycle to generate ids from.
Number cycles are identified by their name.
User can create new number cycles and edit them clicking on the button btn:[Edit Number Cycles...]

Kraft supports a counter that is incremented for every new document of a certain type.
In addition to the counter, more information can be added to form an useful number, such as constant text or parts of the date.

See the following table for available variables which can be used:

|===

| `%y` or `%yyyy` | the year of the document date.
| `%yy`           | the year of the document (two digits).
| `%w`            | the week number of the document date.
| `%ww`           | the week number of the document date with leading zero.
| `%d`            | the day number of the document date.
| `%dd`           | the day number of the document date with leading zero.
| `%m` or `%M`    | the month number of the document date.
| `%MM`           | the month number with leading zero.
| `%c`            | the customer id from kaddressbook
| `%i`            | the unique counter *(mandatory)*
| `%type`         | the localised doc type (offer, invoice etc.)
| `%uid`          | the contact id of the client.

|===

=== Taxes

In many countries there are two kinds of VAT-taxes for sold products.

A high level and
a low level.

Fill here the appropriate amounts in for the high level and the low level.
If the tax-level is changing, then you add here the start date with the new tax-levels.

=== Wages

A list of wage costs is maintained in Kraft. The items are used in
templates and during calculation.

All data can be edited, customized and new items can be added in the
Kraft Configuration Dialog reachable through the Settings menu.

Remember that these units are later used in the documents, it is
therefor important that you translate them to your own language and to
fill in the correct prices.

=== Units of measurement

A list of units of measurement is maintained in Kraft. In Kraft Configuration Dialog reachable through the Settings menu can you edit and customize items already in the
list, and also can you add new items to the list.

Remember that these units are later used in the documents, it is
therefor important that you translate them to your own language.

=== Own identity

Check here if the information that you have given during the initial
setup is correct for the use in the documents.

____
WARNING:
If you made the choice to use the information from KaddressBook then is
the information from a later manual entry ignored.
____

After we have made some corrections to the configuration, we go back to
the main window.Here we see three tabs:

* Documents
* Timeline
* Catalogs

We go first to catalogs.

=== Catalog

In the tab catalog are two different catalogs:

`Material`

A catalog of material that are sold, with their purchase prices, the
profit and the sell-price.

and `Standard Templates`

A catalog of standard recipes of work like planting trees.

Both catalogs can have chapters and sub-chapters for to organize your
templates. First we are going to fill in the

After this we are going to create a offer for some work in a garden.

[[Offer]]
=== Creating an Offer

The client has asked to plant a tree, we will offer 3 different trees which we can plant.

Beside this, we have seen that there is a lifeless three, which we will offer to remove as extra work.

button btn:[Print Document] for making a PDF what we can print out or send to
the client.

After your first invoice is now your first offer now also ready for
sending.

[[Customization]]
== Customization

Kraft can be customized in most of the graphical user interface and in particular
in the output it generates.

=== Output Document Customization

Each document type in Kraft can have it's own template that is used to create
a PDF. The template is filled with values from the document content that the user
entered in Krafts specialized editors on the desktop. After that it is converted to PDF
using a document creation script.

This makes sure that Kraft documents are always high standard quality, similar looking
and generated very quickly.

==== WeasyPrint Documents

With https://weasyprint.org[WeasyPrint] Kraft uses a very powerful HTML and CSS based generator that makes it very easy to create highly customized documents which fit the users expectations. The general idea is that Weasyprint loads html output that is processed to PDF, considering a Cascading Stylesheet file which has a huge impact on how the PDF document looks in the end.

To use a WeasyPrint based template for a document simply create a template file and save it with the extension *.gtmpl*. With that file extension Kraft automatically uses WeasyPrint and also the Grantlee templating for rendering. An example for a WeasyPrint document is can be found in the Kraft package in the reports directory and is called invoice.gtmpl.

To use a WeasyPrint template with one of the Kraft document types just select the template file name (with the right extension `*.gtml`) in the Kraft Settings Dialog.

From version 0.95 on Kraft ships with an example document in the Grantlee- and WeasyPrint format. It can be found at `/usr/share/kraft/reports/invoice.gtmpl` or https://github.com/dragotin/kraft/blob/master/reports/invoice.gtmpl[online on Github].

To effectively change the look of the document `kraft.css` (https://github.com/dragotin/kraft/blob/master/reports/kraft.css[on Github]) needs to be considered. It defines most of the look.

==== Template Variables

To generate the PDF, Kraft has to transfer data from the document you have been working on in Kraft to the input document that is processed to an PDF utilising WeasyPrint. For that, Kraft uses a text template. In that, Kraft replaces variables with the actual values.

The syntax is based on the Django syntax for templates described in the https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/[the docs].
