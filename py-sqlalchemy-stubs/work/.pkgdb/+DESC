Mypy plugin and stubs for SQLAlchemy
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dropbox/sqlalchemy-stubs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dropbox/sqlalchemy-stubs)
[![Checked with mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/static/mypy_badge.svg)](http://mypy-lang.org/)

This package contains [type stubs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) and a
[mypy plugin](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending_mypy.html#extending-mypy-using-plugins)
to provide more precise static types and type inference for
[SQLAlchemy framework](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/). SQLAlchemy uses some
Python "magic" that makes having precise types for some code patterns problematic.
This is why we need to accompany the stubs with mypy plugins. The final goal is to
be able to get precise types for most common patterns. Currently, basic operations
with models are supported. A simple example:
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
