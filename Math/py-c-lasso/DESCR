# c-lasso: a Python package for constrained sparse regression and classification 


c-lasso is a Python package that enables sparse and robust linear regression and classification with linear equality
constraints on the model parameters. For detailed info, one can check the [documentation](https://c-lasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The forward model is assumed to be: 

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=X\beta&plus;\sigma\epsilon\qquad\text{s.t.}\qquad&space;C\beta=0" title="y=X\beta+\sigma\epsilon\qquad\text{s.t.}\qquad C\beta=0" />

Here, y and X are given outcome and predictor data. The vector y can be continuous (for regression) or binary (for classification). C is a general constraint matrix. The vector &beta; comprises the unknown coefficients and &sigma; an 
unknown scale.

The package handles several different estimators for inferring &beta; (and &sigma;), including 
the constrained Lasso, the constrained scaled Lasso, and sparse Huber M-estimation with linear equality constraints.
Several different algorithmic strategies, including path and proximal splitting algorithms, are implemented to solve 
the underlying convex optimization problems.
