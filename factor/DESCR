# Factor

Factor is a [concatenative](https://www.concatenative.org), stack-based
programming language with [high-level
features](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Features/The%20language)
including dynamic types, extensible syntax, macros, and garbage collection.
On a practical side, Factor has a [full-featured
library](https://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-vocab-index.html),
supports many different platforms, and has been extensively documented.

The implementation is [fully
compiled](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Optimizing%20compiler)
for performance, while still supporting [interactive
development](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Interactive%20development).
Factor applications are portable between all common platforms.  Factor can
[deploy stand-alone
applications](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Factor/Deployment) on all
platforms.  Full source code for the Factor project is available under a BSD
license.
