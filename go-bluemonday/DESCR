bluemonday is a HTML sanitizer implemented in Go.
It is fast and highly configurable. bluemonday 
takes untrusted user generated content as an input,
and will return HTML that has been sanitised against
a whitelist of approved HTML elements and attributes
so that you can safely include the content in your web page.
