# GLFW 3.3 for Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/go-gl/glfw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/go-gl/glfw) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw)

## Installation

* GLFW C library source is included and built automatically as part of the Go package. But you need to make sure you have dependencies of GLFW:
	* On macOS, you need Xcode or Command Line Tools for Xcode (`xcode-select --install`) for required headers and libraries.
	* On Ubuntu/Debian-like Linux distributions, you need `libgl1-mesa-dev` and `xorg-dev` packages.
	* On CentOS/Fedora-like Linux distributions, you need `libX11-devel libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXxf86vm-devel` packages.
	* See [here](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html#compile_deps) for full details.
* Go 1.4+ is required on Windows (otherwise you must use MinGW v4.8.1 exactly, see [Go issue 8811](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8811)).

### OpenGL ES

If your target system only provides an OpenGL ES implementation (true for some ARM boards), you need to link against that implementation.
You do this by defining the appropriate build tags, e.g.
