Introduction
------------

This library is an implementation of the JSON-LD_ specification in Python_.

JSON, as specified in RFC7159_, is a simple language for representing
objects on the Web. Linked Data is a way of describing content across
different documents or Web sites. Web resources are described using
IRIs, and typically are dereferencable entities that may be used to find
more information, creating a "Web of Knowledge". JSON-LD_ is intended
to be a simple publishing method for expressing not only Linked Data in
JSON, but for adding semantics to existing JSON.
