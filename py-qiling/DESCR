- Cross platform: Windows, MacOS, Linux, BSD, UEFI, DOS
- Cross architecture: X86, X86_64, Arm, Arm64, MIPS, 8086
- Multiple file formats: PE, MachO, ELF, COM
- Emulate & sandbox machine code in a isolated environment
- Supports cross architecture and platform debugging capabilities
- Provide high level API to setup & configure the sandbox
- Fine-grain instrumentation: allow hooks at various levels (instruction/basic-block/memory-access/exception/syscall/IO/etc)
- Allow dynamic hotpatch on-the-fly running code, including the loaded library
- True framework in Python, making it easy to build customized security analysis tools on top
