=================

Go-datastructures is a collection of useful, performant, and threadsafe Go
datastructures.

### NOTE: only tested with Go 1.3+.

#### Augmented Tree

Interval tree for collision in n-dimensional ranges.  Implemented via a
red-black augmented tree.  Extra dimensions are handled in simultaneous
inserts/queries to save space although this may result in suboptimal time

inserts, deletes, and queries should be in O(log n) time.

#### Bitarray

Bitarray used to detect existence without having to resort to hashing with
