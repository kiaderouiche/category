# stack

Package stack implements utilities to capture, manipulate, and format call
stacks. It provides a simpler API than package runtime.

The implementation takes care of the minutia and special cases of interpreting
the program counter (pc) values returned by runtime.Callers.

## Versioning

Package stack publishes releases via [semver](http://semver.org/) compatible Git
tags prefixed with a single 'v'. The master branch always contains the latest
release. The develop branch contains unreleased commits.
