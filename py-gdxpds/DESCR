gdx-pandas: Python package to translate between gdx (GAMS data) and pandas. 

There are two main ways to use gdxpds. The first use case is the one that was 
initially supported: direct conversion between GDX files on disk and pandas 
DataFrames or a csv version thereof. Starting with the Version 1.0.0 rewrite,
there is now a second style of use which involves interfacing with GDX files and 
symbols via the `gdxpds.gdx.GdxFile` and `gdxpds.gdx.GdxSymbol` classes.

DEPENDENCIES
