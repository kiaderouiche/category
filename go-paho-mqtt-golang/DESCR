Eclipse Paho MQTT Go client
===========================


This repository contains the source code for the [Eclipse Paho](https://eclipse.org/paho) MQTT 3.1/3.11 Go client library. 

This code builds a library which enable applications to connect to an [MQTT](https://mqtt.org) broker to publish 
messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages.

This library supports a fully asynchronous mode of operation.

A client supporting MQTT V5 is [also available](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.golang).
