GoJay is a performant JSON encoder/decoder for Golang
It has a simple API and doesn't use reflection. It relies
on small interfaces to decode/encode structures and slices.
Gojay also comes with powerful stream decoding features and
an even faster Unsafe API. There is also a code generation
tool to make usage easier and faster.
