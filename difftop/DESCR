Welcome to DiffTop version 1.0.0

A code for the calculation of the 
differential and total cross section 
for heavy-quark production at hadron colliders.

Cross sections are calculated in 1PI kinematics 
at LO, approx NLO and approx NNLO in QCD, 
by employing techniques of QCD threshold resummation 
beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.

Please refer to the following papers 
if you are using this code:

arXiv:1406.0386 [hep-ph];
arXiv:1409.0444 [hep-ph];
arXiv:1308.1635 [hep-ph];
