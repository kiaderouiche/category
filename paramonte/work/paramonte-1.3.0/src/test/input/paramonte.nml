! NOTES:
! Comments must begin with an exclamation mark (!).
! Comments can appear anywhere on an empty line or, after a value assignement.
! The order of the input variables in the ParaDRAM namelist is irrelevant and unimportant.
! Variables can be defined multiple times, but only the last definition will be considered as input.
! All variable names are case insensitive. However, for clarity, this software follows the Camel-Case code-writing practice.
! String values must be enclosed with either single or double quotation marks.
! Logical values are case-insensitive and can be either .true., true, or t for TRUE value, and .false., false, or f for FALSE value.
! All vectors and arrays in the input file begin with index 1, following the convention of the majority 
! of science-oriented programming languages: Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, R, Mathematica
