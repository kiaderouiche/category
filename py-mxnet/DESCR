Apache MXNet is a deep learning framework designed
for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you
to mix symbolic and imperative programming to maximize
efficiency and productivity. At its core, MXNet contains
a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically
parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on
the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes
symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. MXNet is
portable and lightweight, scalable to many GPUs and machines
