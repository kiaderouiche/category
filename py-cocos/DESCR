# ![coconut](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelnowotny/cocos/master/images/coconut-isolated-tiny.jpg) Cocos (Core Computational System) - Scientific GPU Computing in Python


## Overview

Cocos is a package for numeric and scientific computing on GPUs for Python with a NumPy-like API. 
It supports both CUDA and OpenCL on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. 
Internally, it relies on the ArrayFire C/C++ library.
Cocos offers a multi-GPU map-reduce framework. 
In addition to its numeric functionality, it allows parallel computation of SymPy expressions on the GPU.

## Highlights

*   Fast vectorized computation on GPUs with a NumPy-like API.
*   Multi GPU support via map-reduce.
*   High-performance random number generators for beta, chi-square, exponential, gamma, logistic, lognormal, normal, uniform, and Wald distributions. Antithetic random numbers for uniform and normal distributions.
*   Provides a GPU equivalent to SymPy's lambdify, which enables numeric evaluation of symbolic SymPy (multi-dimensional array) expressions on the GPU for vectors of input parameters in parallel.
*   Adaptation of SciPy's gaussian_kde to the GPU
