# libinput-touch-translator
Map actions in touch screen and touchpad to keyboard shortcuts or other input devices.

# Introduction

This project is aim to providing a common resolusion for translate an "unclear" touch action on PC to exsited one our computer can recognize, often a global shortcut. 

## Background

There are some similar projects, such as [**libinput-gesetures**](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures) and [**touchegg**](http://code.google.com/p/touchegg), having a good performance about improving user interaction of touching.

However, the exsited projects are almost platform related, they might work well on X11, but not well on Wayland. So, I reference their idea and reimplement a new project, which we are talking about.

## How it works

The main idea of the project is very simple. First, get the touch event and recognize them. Next, get the crosponding action which exsited in our computer. Last, execute the action for responding the touch event.

## Advantage and disadvantage

As I said, this project is aim to providing a common resolution, that means no what X11 or Wayland will get the same interaction. However, due to the tech limited, I can't not do so much at the side of event response. For now it only support the basic keyborad(mostly) and mouse event's mapping.
