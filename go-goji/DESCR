Goji is a minimalistic web framework that values composability and simplicity.

This project has been superseded by a [new version of Goji][goji2] by the same
author, which has very similar primitives and semantics, but has been updated to
reflect several years of experience with this library and the surrounding Go
ecosystem. This project is still well-loved and well-maintained, and will be for
the foreseeable future, but new projects are encouraged to use `goji.io`
instead.
