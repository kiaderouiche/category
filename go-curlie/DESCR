# Curlie

If you like the interface of [HTTPie](https://httpie.org) but miss the features of [curl](https://curl.haxx.se), curlie is what you are searching for. Curlie is a frontend to `curl` that adds the ease of use of `httpie`, without compromising on features and performance. All `curl` options are exposed with syntax sugar and output formatting inspired from `httpie`.

## Install

Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install rs/tap/curlie
```

Using [pkg](https://man.freebsd.org/pkg/8):

```
pkg install curlie
```

Or download a [binary package](https://github.com/rs/curlie/releases/latest).
