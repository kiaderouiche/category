go-metrics
==========

This library provides a `metrics` package which can be used to instrument code,
expose application metrics, and profile runtime performance in a flexible manner.

Current API: [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/armon/go-metrics?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/armon/go-metrics)

Sinks
-----

The `metrics` package makes use of a `MetricSink` interface to support delivery
to any type of backend. Currently the following sinks are provided:

* StatsiteSink : Sinks to a [statsite](https://github.com/armon/statsite/) instance (TCP)
* StatsdSink: Sinks to a [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) / statsite instance (UDP)
* PrometheusSink: Sinks to a [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint (exposed via HTTP for scrapes)
* InmemSink : Provides in-memory aggregation, can be used to export stats
* FanoutSink : Sinks to multiple sinks. Enables writing to multiple statsite instances for example.
* BlackholeSink : Sinks to nowhere
