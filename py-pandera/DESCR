pandas data structures contain information that pandera
explicitly validates at runtime. This is useful in
production-critical or reproducible research settings.
With pandera, you can:

 Check the types and properties of columns in a DataFrame
 or values in a Series.
 Perform more complex statistical validation like hypothesis testing.
 Seamlessly integrate with existing data analysis/processing
 pipelines via function decorators.

pandera provides a flexible and expressive API for performing
data validation on tidy (long-form) and wide data to make
data processing pipelines more readable and robust
