This is a golang ALSA client implementation,
without cgo! Unfortunately, doing it without
cgo means throwing away many years of
compatibility work that has been put into
libalsa. So be warned, this library is not likely
to work with a lot of the more colorful audio
cards out there, and is not likely to work on
platforms other than x86_64.
