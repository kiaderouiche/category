The zerolog package provides a fast and simple logger dedicated to JSON output.

Zerolog's API is designed to provide both a great developer experience and stunning [performance](#performance). Its unique chaining API allows zerolog to write JSON log events by avoiding allocations and reflection.

The uber's [zap](https://godoc.org/go.uber.org/zap) library pioneered this approach. Zerolog is taking this concept to the next level with simpler to use API and even better performance.

To keep the code base and the API simple, zerolog focuses on JSON logging only. As [suggested on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6c9k7n/zerolog_is_now_faster_than_zap/), you may use tools like [humanlog](https://github.com/aybabtme/humanlog) to pretty print JSON on the console during development.
