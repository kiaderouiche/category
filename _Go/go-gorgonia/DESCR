Gorgonia is a library that helps facilitate machine learning in Go. Write and evaluate mathematical equations involving multidimensional arrays easily. If this sounds like [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), it's because the idea is quite similar. Specifically, the library is pretty low-level, like Theano, but has higher goals like Tensorflow.

Gorgonia:

* Can perform automatic differentiation
* Can perform symbolic differentiation
* Can perform gradient descent optimizations
* Can perform numerical stabilization
* Provides a number of convenience functions to help create neural networks
* Is fairly quick (comparable to Theano and Tensorflow's speed)
* Supports CUDA/GPGPU computation (OpenCL not yet supported, send a pull request)
* Will support distributed computing
