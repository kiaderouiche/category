Jet is a template engine developed to be easy to use, powerful, dynamic, yet secure and very fast.

* simple and familiar syntax
* supports template inheritance (`extends`) and composition (`block`/`yield`, `import`, `include`)
* descriptive error messages with filename and line number
* auto-escaping
* simple C-like expressions
* very fast execution â€“ Jet can execute templates faster than some pre-compiled template engines
* very light in terms of allocations and memory footprint
