An open framework to assemble ultra performance API Gateways with middlewares; core service of the [KrakenD API Gateway](http://www.krakend.io).

Looking for the API gateway ready to use?

## Motivation

Consumers of REST API content (specially in microservices) often query backend services that weren't coded for the UI implementation. This is of course a good practice, but the UI consumers need to do implementations that suffer a lot of complexity and burden with the sizes of their microservices responses.

KrakenD is an **API Gateway** builder and proxy generator that sits between the client and all the source servers, adding a new layer that removes all the complexity to the clients, providing them only the information that the UI needs. KrakenD acts as an **aggregator** of many sources into single endpoints and allows you to group, wrap, transform and shrink responses. Additionally it supports a myriad of middlewares and plugins that allow you to extend the functionality, such as adding Oauth authorization or security layers.
