# gophernotes - Use Go in Jupyter notebooks and nteract

`gophernotes` is a Go kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and [nteract](https://nteract.io/).  It lets you use Go interactively in a browser-based notebook or desktop app.  Use `gophernotes` to create and share documents that contain live Go code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  These notebooks, with the live Go code, can then be shared with others via email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Go forth and do data science, or anything else interesting, with Go notebooks!

**Acknowledgements** - This project utilizes a Go interpreter called [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro) under the hood to evaluate Go code interactively. The gophernotes logo was designed by the brilliant [Marcus Olsson](https://github.com/marcusolsson) and was inspired by Renee French's original Go Gopher design.
