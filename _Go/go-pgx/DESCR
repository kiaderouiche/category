# pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit

pgx is a pure Go driver and toolkit for PostgreSQL.

pgx aims to be low-level, fast, and performant, while also enabling PostgreSQL-specific features that the standard `database/sql` package does not allow for.

The driver component of pgx can be used alongside the standard `database/sql` package.

The toolkit component is a related set of packages that implement PostgreSQL functionality such as parsing the wire protocol
and type mapping between PostgreSQL and Go. These underlying packages can be used to implement alternative drivers,
proxies, load balancers, logical replication clients, etc.

The current release of `pgx v4` requires Go modules. To use the previous version, checkout and vendor the `v3` branch.

## Example Usage
