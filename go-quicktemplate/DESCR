# quicktemplate

A fast, powerful, yet easy to use template engine for Go.
Inspired by the [Mako templates](http://www.makotemplates.org/) philosophy.

# Features

  * [Extremely fast](#performance-comparison-with-htmltemplate).
    Templates are converted into Go code and then compiled.
  * Quicktemplate syntax is very close to Go - there is no need to learn
    yet another template language before starting to use quicktemplate.
  * Almost all bugs are caught during template compilation, so production
    suffers less from template-related bugs.
  * Easy to use. See [quickstart](#quick-start) and [examples](https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate/tree/master/examples)
    for details.
  * Powerful. Arbitrary Go code may be embedded into and mixed with templates.
