A tiny cross-platform webview library for C/C++/Golang to build modern cross-platform GUIs. Also, there are [Rust bindings](https://github.com/Boscop/webview-rs), [Python bindings](https://github.com/zserge/webview-python), [Nim bindings](https://github.com/oskca/webview), [Haskell](https://github.com/lettier/webviewhs), [C# bindings](https://github.com/iwillspeak/webview-cs) and [Java bindings](https://github.com/shannah/webviewjar) available.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Webview is now being rewritten from scratch, with the support of EdgeHTML and using C++14 as a primary language (code becomes much shorter/cleaner, and we still have C and Go APIs as the primary interface). Please have a look at [webview-x](https://github.com/zserge/webview/tree/webview-x) branch before opening new issues. Current version of webview is still maintained, PRs with bugfixes are welcome, but new functionality will be added to the new branch. I expect to finish the new branch before March 2020, but no hard deadlines.**

It supports two-way JavaScript bindings (to call JavaScript from C/C++/Go and to call C/C++/Go from JavaScript).

It uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) on Windows.
