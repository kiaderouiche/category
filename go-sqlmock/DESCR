# Sql driver mock for Golang

**sqlmock** is a mock library implementing [sql/driver](https://godoc.org/database/sql/driver). Which has one and only
purpose - to simulate any **sql** driver behavior in tests, without needing a real database connection. It helps to
maintain correct **TDD** workflow.

- this library is now complete and stable. (you may not find new changes for this reason)
- supports concurrency and multiple connections.
- supports **go1.8** Context related feature mocking and Named sql parameters.
- does not require any modifications to your source code.
- the driver allows to mock any sql driver method behavior.
- has strict by default expectation order matching.
- has no third party dependencies.

**NOTE:** in **v1.2.0** **sqlmock.Rows** has changed to struct from interface, if you were using any type references to that
...
