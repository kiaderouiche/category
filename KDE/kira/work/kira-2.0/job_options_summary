Summary of all job options. This file is work in progress.

### reduce_sectors
Initiates a reduction based on IBP identities.
## reduce
Sub option of the option 'reduce_sectors'.
Control the size of the system of equations based on the following parameters:
# topologies
List all relevant topologies for the reduction.
# sectors
List all sectors in big-endian binary notation or in sector number notations.
# r
The sum of all positive indices.
# s
The sum of all negative indices.
# d
Sum of maximal number of dots (optional).


### reduce_user_defined_system
Reduce a system of equations defined in separate files or directories.
## input_system
Reads a system of equations from several files or directories.

### select_integrals
Select integrals relevant for the reduction.
## select_mandatory_recursively
Control the number of selected integrals based on the following parameters:
# topologies
List all relevant topologies for the reduction.
# sectors
List all sectors in big-endian binary notation or in sector number notations.
# r
The sum of all positive indices.
# s
The sum of all negative indices.
# d
Sum of maximal number of dots (optional).
or
## select_mandatory_list
Choose a file containing all integrals to be reduced.

### preferred_masters
A file containing preferred master integrals or master equations.

### integral_ordering
Choose one of 8 different integral orderings.
Default: 1

### run_symmetries
Kira generates the symmetry relations and gets the set of zero sectors.

### run_initiate
Kira generates the system of equations.

### run_triangular
Kira performs the forward elimination. This option accepts arguments true or sectorwise.

### run_back_substitution
Kira performs the back substitution.

### run_firefly
Performs the reduction with the help of FireFly:
run_firefly: true, start the reduction after 'run_initiate' has finished (replaces 'run_triangular' and 'run_back_substitution').
run_firefly: back, start the reduction after 'run_triangular' has finished (replaces 'run_back_substitution').

### factor_scan
Only available for 'run_firefly'.
Determines and factors out univariate factors in the master integral coefficients before interpolating them (this can simplify the coefficients).
Default: false for < 3 variables, true for >= 3 variables


### iterative_reduction
Performs the reduction of integrals masterwise or sectorwise, sequentially.
This leads to improved main memory usage.

### insert_prefactors
Only available for 'run_firefly'.
Imports a file with factors for master integral coefficients.
First integral denotes an integral which is supposed to be reduced with coefficient 1.
All other integrals are master integrals and contain coefficients, which are rational functions.
Kira will use these coefficients to divide them out during 'run_firefly' and restore them in the final result.

### alt_dir
Kira saves the data in the 'results', 'tmp' and 'sectormappings' directory at a new user provided path location.
Default: "."

### data_file
Write all integrals appearing in the reduction and the results to a human readable form.
Default: false.

### write_numerical_system
Get the solved system of equations from pyRed numerically.

### select_masters_reduction
Make a choice which master integrals will not be set to zero.

### generate_input
Generates a system of equations and saves the files to the input_kira directory. The file format is valid for further reduction of this system of equations with the option 'input_system'. If the option 'weight_notation: true' is set, the generated system of equations is written in the seed notation. Else, it is written in the weight bit notation. If the option 'amplitude_translate' is used, Kira imports a file which contains integrals times the coefficients. Kira will treat the input as the right-hand-side of an equation. This right-hand-side is translated into the weight bit notation, while the left-hand-side of this equation gets assigned a big weight-bit number. This weight-bit number may be used in later reduction steps to reduce the left-hand-side of this equation.

### conditional
If the reduction terminates before it is finished, Kira will resume the reduction.
Default: true

### set_zero_sectors
Make a choice which master integrals will not be set to zero. This modifies the 
files 'nonTrivialSector' and 'trivialsector'. 

### lorenz_invariance
Disables/enables the Lorenz invariance identities.
Default: true

##algebraic_reconstruction
'run_back_substitution' uses methods to interpolate coefficients documented in arXiv:1812.01491.
