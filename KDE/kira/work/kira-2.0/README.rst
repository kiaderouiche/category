Installation
============

A statically linked executable of ``Kira 2.0`` for ``Linux x86_64`` is available on https://kira.hepforge.org. This executable has all optional features included except for ``MPI``. If you require ``MPI``, you must compile ``Kira`` yourself against the ``MPI`` version used on your computer cluster.

To build ``Kira`` from source, clone the ``release`` branch of the ``Git`` repository with

::

   git clone https://gitlab.com/kira-pyred/kira.git -b release

to obtain the latest release version, or the ``master`` branch with

::

   git clone https://gitlab.com/kira-pyred/kira.git

to obtain the lastest development snapshot. Specific releases are available as ``Git tags``, e.g. ``kira-2.0``.

Prerequisites
-------------

Compiler requirements: A ``C++`` compiler supporting the ``C++14`` standard and a ``C`` compiler supporting the ``C11`` standard.











**Platform requirements**

``Linux x86_64`` or ``macOS``.

**Compiler requirements**

A ``C++`` compiler supporting the ``C++14`` standard and a ``C`` compiler supporting the ``C11`` standard.

**Build system requirements**

``Kira`` can either be built with the ``Meson`` build system (http://mesonbuild.com) version ``0.46`` (or later) and ``Ninja`` (https://ninja-build.org), or with the ``Autotools`` build system. We recommend to use the ``Meson`` build system.

If ``Meson`` is not available on your system, it can be installed with

::

   pip3 install --user meson

(requires ``Python 3.5`` or later). With the option ``--user``, ``Meson`` can be installed as unprivileged user into the home directory (``~/.local/bin``). The ``Ninja`` binary can be downloaded from https://ninja-build.org.

**Dependencies**

``Kira`` requires the following packages to be installed on the system:

- ``GiNaC`` (https://www.ginac.de), which itself requires ``CLN`` (https://www.ginac.de/CLN),
- ``zlib`` (http://zlib.net/).
- ``Fermat`` (http://home.bway.net/lewis) is required to run ``Kira``.

If the ``Fermat`` executable is not found automatically at startup, or a specific ``Fermat`` installation should be used, the path to the ``Fermat`` executable can be provided via the environment variable ``FERMATPATH``.

Depending on the enabled optional features of ``Kira``, the following packages are required in addition:

- ``GMP`` (https://gmplib.org) if ``FireFly`` is used,
- ``MPFR`` (https://www.mpfr.org) if ``FLINT`` is used,
- ``MPI`` (disabled by default) for parallelization on computer clusters,
- ``jemalloc`` (disabled by default) (http://jemalloc.net) for more efficient memory allocation.

The following dependencies can be automatically built and installed as subprojects with the ``Meson`` build system. I.e. if they are not found on the system, they will be built automatically along with ``Kira``.

- ``yaml-cpp`` (required) (https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp),
- ``FireFly`` (optional, enabled by default). If you decide to install ``FireFly`` manually, we recommend to use the version from the branch ``kira-2`` of the ``Git`` repository at https://gitlab.com/firefly-library/firefly. This branch will remain compatible with ``Kira 2.0``.
- ``FLINT`` (optional, enabled by default) (http://www.flintlib.org). We recommend using ``FLINT``, because it not only offers better performance for the finite field arithmetic, but is also required to enable some features of ``FireFly``, most notably the factor scan.

If the ``Autotools`` build system is used, all enabled dependencies must be installed manually. If ``FireFly`` is not build as a subproject, to use ``FLINT`` and ``MPI``, they must be enabled in ``FireFly``'s ``CMake`` build system.

Note that ``GiNaC``, ``CLN``, ``yaml-cpp``, and ``FireFly`` must have been compiled with the same compiler which is used to compile ``Kira``. Otherwise the linking step will most likely fail. If you are using the system compiler, you can usually install ``GiNaC``, ``CLN``, and ``yaml-cpp`` via your system's package manager. However, if you are using a different compiler, this usually means in practice that you also have to build these packages from source and, if installed with a non-default installation prefix, the environment variables ``C_PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` must be set accordingly.

Compiling Kira with the Meson build system
------------------------------------------

To build ``Kira`` with the ``Meson`` build system, ``Meson 0.46`` (or later) and ``Ninja`` are required.

To compile and install ``Kira``, run

::

   meson --prefix=/install/path builddir
   cd builddir
   ninja
   ninja install

where ``builddir`` is the build directory. Specifying the installation prefix with ``--prefix`` is optional.

**Build options**

- ``-Dfirefly=false`` (default: ``true``): Build without ``FireFly`` support.
- ``-Dflint=false`` (default: ``true``): If ``FireFly`` is built as a subproject, disable ``FLINT``.
- ``-Dmpi=true`` (default: ``false``): If ``FireFly`` is built as a subproject, enable ``MPI``. This is known to work best with ``OpenMPI`` (https://www.open-mpi.org). For performance reasons, we recommend ``MPICH`` (https://www.mpich.org), though.
- ``-Dcustom-mpi=<name>``: If your ``MPI`` installation provides a ``pkg-config`` file, but is not found automatically with ``-Dmpi=true``, pass the name of the ``MPI`` implementation as ``<name>``, e.g. ``-Dcustom-mpi=mpich``. Some systems don't provide a ``pkg-config`` file for ``MPICH``. In that case we recommend to install ``FireFly`` with its own ``CMake`` build system instead.
- ``-Djemalloc=true`` (default: ``false``): Link with the ``jemalloc`` memory allocator. This can lead to significantly increased performance, often by more than 20% from our experience if ``FireFly`` is used. However, using ``jemalloc`` may not work on some systems, especially in combination with certain ``MPI`` implementations (This can depend on subtleties like the linking order of the ``jemalloc`` and ``MPI`` libraries). Alternatively, to use ``jemalloc``, one can set the environment variable ``LD_PRELOAD`` to point to ``jemalloc.so`` and export it.

To show the full list of available build options, run
\code{meson}\;\code{configure} in the build directory.

**Subprojects**

If ``yaml-cpp`` or ``FireFly`` are not found on the system, per default they will be downloaded and built as ``Meson`` subprojects. If the option ``-Dflint=true`` (default) is set and ``FireFly`` is built as a subproject, also ``FLINT`` will be downloaded and built as a subproject if it is not found on the system.

The usage of subprojects can be controlled with the following options:

- ``--wrap-mode=nodownload``: Do not download subprojects, but build them if already available (and not found on the system).
- ``--wrap-mode=nofallback``: Do not build subprojects, even if the libraries are not found on the system.
- ``--wrap-mode=forcefallback``: Build subprojects even if the libraries can be found on the system.
- ``--force-fallback-for=<deps>``: Like ``forcefallback``, but only for dependencies in the comma separated list ``<deps>``. Overrides ``nofallback`` and ``forcefallback``.

These options are only fully supported with ``Meson 0.49`` or later. For details see https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html.

*Note:* Subprojects are not updated automatically. To update subprojects, run

::

   meson subprojects update

(requires ``Meson 0.49`` or later). ``Git`` subprojects can of course also be manually updated by running

::

   git pull

in the corresponding subproject directory (e.g. ``subprojects/firefly``).

Compiling Kira with the Autotools build system
----------------------------------------------

To compile and install ``Kira`` with the ``Autotools`` build system, first run

::

   autoreconf -i

and then compile and install with

::

   ./configure --prefix=/install/path --enable-firefly=yes
   make
   make install

where the optional ``--prefix`` argument sets the installation prefix. Without the option ``--enable-firefly=yes``, ``Kira`` will be built without ``FireFly`` support. Note that subproject installation is not supported with the ``Autotools`` build system, i.e. all dependencies must be installed manually.
