munch
==========

munch is a fork of David Schoonover's **Bunch** package, providing similar functionality. 99% of the work was done by him, and the fork was made mainly for lack of responsiveness for fixes and maintenance on the original code.

Munch is a dictionary that supports attribute-style access, a la JavaScript:

```python

>>> b = Munch()
>>> b.hello = 'world'
>>> b.hello
'world'
>>> b['hello'] += "!"
>>> b.hello
...
