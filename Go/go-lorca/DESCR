<p>
	A very small library to build modern HTML5 desktop apps in Go. It uses Chrome
	browser as a UI layer. Unlike Electron it doesn't bundle Chrome into the app
	package, but rather reuses the one that is already installed. Lorca
	establishes a connection to the browser window and allows calling Go code
	from the UI and manipulating UI from Go in a seamless manner.
