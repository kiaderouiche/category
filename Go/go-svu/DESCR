Semantic Version Util is a tool to manage semantic versions at ease!

You can print the current version, increase patch/minor/major manually or just
get the next tag based on your git log!

## Example usage:

### `svu`

Based on the log between the latest tag and `HEAD`, prints the next tag.

> aliases: `svu next` and `svu n`

```sh
$ svu
v1.3.0
...
