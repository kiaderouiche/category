Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and
load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Traefik
integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker,
Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon
ECS, ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the only configuration
step you need.
