## What is QOR?

QOR is a set of libraries written in Go that abstracts common features needed for business applications, CMSs, and E-commerce systems.

This is a complete rewrite in Go, of the original QOR, which was a proprietary framework written in Ruby on Rails and used internally at [The Plant](https://theplant.jp). QOR 1.0 is the first version to be open sourced and distributed under the MIT license.

### What QOR is not
