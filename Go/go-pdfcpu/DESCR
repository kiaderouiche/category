pdfcpu is a PDF processing library written in [Go](http://golang.org) supporting encryption.
It provides both an API and a CLI. Supported are all versions up to PDF 1.7 (ISO-32000).

## Motivation

This is an effort to build a comprehensive PDF processing library from the ground up written in Go. Over time pdfcpu aims to support the standard range of PDF processing features and also any interesting use cases that may present themselves along the way.
