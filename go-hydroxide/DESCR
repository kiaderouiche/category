# hydroxide

A third-party, open-source ProtonMail bridge. For power users only, designed to
run on a server.

hydroxide supports CardDAV, IMAP and SMTP.

Rationale:

* No GUI, only a CLI (so it runs in headless environments)
* Standard-compliant (we don't care about Microsoft Outlook)
* Fully open-source

Feel free to join the IRC channel: ##emersion on irc.freenode.net.

## How does it work?

hydroxide is a server that translates standard protocols (SMTP, IMAP, CardDAV)
into ProtonMail API requests. It allows you to use your preferred e-mail clients
and `git-send-email` with ProtonMail.
