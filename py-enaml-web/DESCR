A web component toolkit for [enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) that
let's you build websites in python declaratively.

> Note: A breaking change was introduced in 0.9.0 usage of `ref` should be replaced with `id`

You can use enaml-web to build "interactive" websites using python, enaml, and a few lines of _simple_ javascript (see the simple pandas [dataframe viewer](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-web/tree/master/examples/dataframe_viewer) example). The view state (dom) is stored on the server as an enaml view and interaction works by syncing changes between
between the client(s) and server using websockets (or polling).

To demonstrate, the following interaction is all handled with enaml-web
