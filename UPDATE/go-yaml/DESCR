# YAML support for the Go language

Introduction
------------

The yaml package enables Go programs to comfortably encode and decode YAML
values. It was developed within [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com) as
part of the [juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com) project, and is based on a
pure Go port of the well-known [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
C library to parse and generate YAML data quickly and reliably.

Compatibility
-------------

The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2, including support for
anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document unmarshalling is not yet
implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are purposefully not
supported since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML 1.2.
