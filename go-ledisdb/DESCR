# LedisDB 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siddontang/ledisdb.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/siddontang/ledisdb)

Ledisdb is a high-performance NoSQL database, similar to Redis, written in [Go](http://golang.org/). It supports many data structures including kv, list, hash, zset, set.

LedisDB now supports multiple different databases as backends.

### **You must run `ledis-upgrade-ttl` before using LedisDB version 0.4, I fixed a very serious bug for key expiration and TTL.**
