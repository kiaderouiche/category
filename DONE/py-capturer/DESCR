The capturer package makes it easy to capture the stdout and stderr
streams of the current process and subprocesses. Output can be relayed
to the terminal in real time but is also available to the Python program
for additional processing It's currently tested on cPython 2.7, 3.5+ and PyPy
(2.7). It's tested on Linux and Mac OS X and may work on other unixes but
definitely won't work on Windows (due to the use of the platform dependent
pty module)
