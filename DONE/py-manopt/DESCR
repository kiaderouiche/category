Pymanopt is a Python toolbox for optimization on manifolds, that
computes gradients and Hessians automatically. It builds upon the
Matlab toolbox Manopt but is otherwise independent of it. Pymanopt
aims to lower the barriers for users wishing to use state of the
art techniques for optimization on manifolds, by relying on
automatic differentiation for computing gradients and Hessians,
saving users time and saving them from potential calculation
and implementiation errors.
