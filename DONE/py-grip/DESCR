Render local readme files before sending off to GitHub.

Grip is a command-line server application written in Python that uses the
[GitHub markdown API][markdown] to render a local readme file. The styles
come directly from GitHub, so you'll know exactly how it will appear. Changes
you make to the Readme will be instantly reflected in the browser without
requiring a page refresh
