taskctl is concurrent task runner that allows you to
design you routine tasks and development pipelines
in nice and neat way in human-readable format
(YAML, JSON or TOML). Given a pipeline (composed
of tasks or other pipelines) it builds a graph
that outlines the execution plan. Each task my run
concurrently or cascade. Beside pipelines, each
single task can be started manually or triggered by
built-in filesystem watcher.
