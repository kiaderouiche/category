Robust and flexible email library for Go

### Email for humans
The ```email``` package is designed to be simple to use, but flexible enough so as not to be restrictive. The goal is to provide an *email interface for humans*.

The ```email``` package currently supports the following:
*  From, To, Bcc, and Cc fields
*  Email addresses in both "test@example.com" and "First Last &lt;test@example.com&gt;" format
*  Text and HTML Message Body
*  Attachments
*  Read Receipts
*  Custom headers
*  More to come!
