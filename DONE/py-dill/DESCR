dill extends python's ``pickle`` module for serializing and de-serializing
python objects to the majority of the built-in python types. Serialization
is the process of converting an object to a byte stream, and the inverse
of which is converting a byte stream back to on python object hierarchy.

``dill`` provides the user the same interface as the ``pickle`` module, and
also includes some additional features. In addition to pickling python
objects, ``dill`` provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter
session in a single command.  Hence, it would be feasable to save a
interpreter session, close the interpreter, ship the pickled file to
another computer, open a new interpreter, unpickle the session and
thus continue from the 'saved' state of the original interpreter
session.
