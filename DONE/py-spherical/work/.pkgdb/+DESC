# Spherical Functions

Python/numba package for evaluating and transforming Wigner's ùîá matrices,
Wigner's 3-j symbols, and spin-weighted (and scalar) spherical harmonics.
These functions are evaluated directly in terms of quaternions, as well as in
the more standard forms of spherical coordinates and Euler
angles.<sup>[1](#1-euler-angles-are-awful)</sup>

The conventions for this package are described in detail on
[this page](http://moble.github.io/spherical/).
