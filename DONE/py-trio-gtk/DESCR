Using the Trio guest mode feature, we can run both the Trio and PyGTK
event loops alongside each other in a single program. This allows us
to make use of the Trio library and the usual async/await syntax and
not have to directly manage thread pools. This library provides a
thin wrapper for initialising the guest mode and exposes a single
public API function, trio_gtk.run into which you can pass your
Trio main function.
