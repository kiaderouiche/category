This module provides a way for securely storing
passwords and other secrets.

It uses D-Bus Secret Service API that is supported
by GNOME Keyring (since version 2.30) and KSecretsService.

The main classes provided are secretstorage.Item,
representing a secret item (that has a label, a secret and
some attributes) and secretstorage.Collection, a place
items are stored in.

SecretStorage supports most of the functions provided by
Secret Service, including creating and deleting items and
collections, editing items, locking and unlocking collections
(asynchronous unlocking is also supported)
