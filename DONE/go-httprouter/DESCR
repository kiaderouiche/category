HttpRouter is a lightweight high performance HTTP request
router (also called multiplexer or just mux for short) for Go.
In contrast to the default mux of Go's net/http package,
this router supports variables in the routing pattern and
matches against the request method. It also scales better.
The router is optimized for high performance and a small
memory footprint. It scales well even with very long paths
and a large number of routes. A compressing dynamic trie
(radix tree) structure is used for efficient matching
