PyArmadillo is a streamlined linear algebra library (matrix maths) for the 
Python language, with emphasis on ease of use Provides high-level syntax and  
functionality deliberately similar to Matlab Alternative to NumPy / SciPy
Provides classes for matrices and cubes; integer, floating point and complex 
elements are supported Various matrix decompositions (eigen, SVD, QR, etc)
are provided via integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance 
implementations (eg. MKL or OpenBLAS) Relies on Armadillo for the underlying
C++ implementation of matrix objects and associated functions
