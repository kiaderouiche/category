Confluent's Python Client for Apache Kafka<sup>TM</sup>
=======================================================

**confluent-kafka-python** provides a high-level Producer, Consumer and AdminClient compatible with all
[Apache Kafka<sup>TM<sup>](http://kafka.apache.org/) brokers >= v0.8, [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
and the [Confluent Platform](https://www.confluent.io/product/compare/). The client is:

- **Reliable** - It's a wrapper around [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) (provided automatically via binary wheels) which is widely deployed in a diverse set of production scenarios. It's tested using [the same set of system tests](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/tree/master/confluent_kafka/kafkatest) as the Java client [and more](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/tree/master/tests). It's supported by [Confluent](https://confluent.io).

- **Performant** - Performance is a key design consideration. Maximum throughput is on par with the Java client for larger message sizes (where the overhead of the Python interpreter has less impact). Latency is on par with the Java client.

- **Future proof** - Confluent, founded by the
creators of Kafka, is building a [streaming platform](https://www.confluent.io/product/compare/)
with Apache Kafka at its core. It's high priority for us that client features keep
pace with core Apache Kafka and components of the [Confluent Platform](https://www.confluent.io/product/compare/).
