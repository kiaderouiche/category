_CBraid_ is a C++ library originally written by **[Jae Choon Cha](http://gt.postech.ac.kr/~jccha/)**.  It allows various computations on braid groups, such as normal forms.  The code in this project is based on his final version of 2001/12/07 and distributed under the GPL.

The library has been updated to run on modern compilers, and has been merged with _Braiding_ version v1.0 (2004/10/04) originally written by **[Juan Gonzalez-Meneses](http://personal.us.es/meneses/index.html)** and distributed under the GPL.  Maria Cumplido contributed some code for computing sets of sliding circuits.

The code is maintained by **[Jean-Luc Thiffeault](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~jeanluc)**.
