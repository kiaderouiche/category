State of the art computational methods are essential to
completely understand Supersymmetry. SuSeFLAV is one
such numerical tool which is capable of investigating
mSUGRA, GMSB, non-universal higgs models and complete
non-universal models. The program solves complete MSSM
RGEs with complete 3 flavor mixing at 2-loop level and
also adds one loop threshold corrections to all MSSM
parameters by incorporating radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking conditions, using standard model fermion masses
and gauge couplings as inputs at the weak scale.
