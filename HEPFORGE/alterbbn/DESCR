AlterBBN is a C program which computes the abundances
of the elements predicted by Big-Bang nucleosynthesis
Different cosmological scenarios are implemented in
AlterBBN, which can alter the BBN predictions. Also,
AlterBBN is included in the SuperIso Relic package so
that the alternative models can be tested using BBN constraints
