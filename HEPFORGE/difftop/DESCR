 DiffTop is the Fortran-based package which allows the user
 to calculate the differential and total cross section for
 heavy-quark pair production at hadron colliders in One-particle
 inclusive (1PI) kinematics. The cross sections are calculated
 in perturbative QCD at approximate next-to-next-to-leading order
 (approx.NNLO) by using methods of threshold resummation beyond
 the leading logarithmic accuracy.
