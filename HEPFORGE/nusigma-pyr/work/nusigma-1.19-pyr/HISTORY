HISTORY for nusigma

---------------- Revision 338: June 19, 2018

* Added a configure system (autoconf) to make the compilation simpler.

---------------- Revision 107: January 7, 2013

* Added kinematical constraints from Levy for all cross section
  calculations. Before, there was unphysical part of phase space
  available at high y that yielded unphysical events. These are now
  taken away.

* Added masses for final state muons and electrons (in addition to the
  earlier added tau masses). The electron and muon masses are not really
  important, but to avoid a tiny region of parameter space where them being
  zero could give rise to an unphysical part of phase space, they are now
  added.

---------------- Revision 52: Tagged as version 1.16

* Expressions for the scattering angle of the outgoing lepton and the
  energy and scattering angle of the hadronic showers updated to more accurate
  expressions. The changes are:
    -  the tau mass is now included when calculating the leptonic and hadronic
       scattering angles for tau-neutrino charged current scattering (the tau
       mass was included before for the cross section, but not in the
       calculation of the scattering angle for tau neutrinos).
    -  for the hadronic shower, the proper invariant mass is now calculated
       and the expressions for the hadronic shower enregy and angle are 
       accordingly updated and more accurate than before.
  Both for the leptonic and hadronic outgoing events, the energy refers (as
  before) to the total energy (including rest mass and kinetic energy).

---------------- 1.15.1 - November 14, 2008

* Changed makefile to compile with full DarkSUSY

---------------- 1.15 - September 4, 2007

* Added tau mass to neutrino-nucleon charged current scattering. This
  causes a suppression of the cross section at low energies. However, when
  used by e.g. WimpAnn, this was never important since at the energies
  where the suppression occurs, these interactions were never very
  important anyway. To be complete, this correction is added though.

  As a consequence of this, neutrino types are now given from 1 to 6 
  (instead of from 1 (neutirno) to 2 (antineutrino) as before). The meaning of
  these neutrino types are
     1 = nu_e
     2 = nu_e-bar
     3 = nu_mu
     4 = nu_mu-bar
     5 = nu_tau
     6 = nu_tau-bar
   Note that it is only for charged currents for nu_tau of nu_tau-bar
   that the tau mass matters and only these differ from the previous
   results. Note that these neutrino codes are the same ones (kfnui) used
   in WimpAnn and WimpEvent.

---------------- 1.14 - June 29, 2007

* Fixed nusig and nusigint routines (for total cross section) to allow
  for lower- and uppercase input. Before, this caused a bug when
  these routines were called from e.g. wimpann and wimpevent.

---------------- 1.13 - May 22, 2007

* Fixed config.pl script. It now works even if your path to where nusigma
  is installed is long.

---------------- 1.12 - September 20, 2006

* Fixed energy and angles of hadronic shower to work even for very
  forward-scattering events

---------------- 1.11 - April 24, 2006

* Caught numerical round-off errors that could give NaN for lepton and hadron
  energies in nuNevent

---------------- 1.1 - March 2006

* Second releae

---------------- 1.0 - 2006

* First release
