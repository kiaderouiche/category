TODO: Adjust the following lines from README

***Chani 1.0.0 README File***

This version comes with the simulation files (definitions.C, connectors.C, initialcharge.C, main.C) for the simulation of the spread and discharge of 10^4 elementary charge which is initially located at the center of the surface.

This simulation can be thought of a "not well documented" tutorial.

In order to run this simulation you need to,
- Specify a valid path for the output files in the seventh line of the file globalConst.h
- Have a valid ROOT installation.
Once you have these, you can run the simulation and see results by running runme.sh by typing
. runme.sh
in the project directory. 

***Main functions and their jobs***

parameters(lx, nx, ly, ny, Nm, sigmas)}: Defines the surface with dimensions lx and ly with surface resistivity sigmas. Tells the simulator to divide the surface in x and y to nx and ny respectively. States that the l matrix is going to be calculated in Nm $\times$ Nm parts. 

computelmn(): Calculates the l-matrix.

addConnector(x, y, R): Adds a ground connection with connector resistance R to the nearest cell to (x, y).
