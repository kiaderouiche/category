# This is an example parameter file.
# Let's write output to another file:
LOGFILE logs/example.log
HEPMCFILE eventfiles/example.hepmc
# Let's change the generation phase space:
PTMIN 10.
PTMAX -1.
ETAMAX 2.5
# this is to include recoil effects
KEEPRECOILS T
# to write the output necessary for subtraction of the thermal momentum components
WRITESCATCEN T
# to write out dummy particles (needed for 4MomSub subtraction)
WRITEDUMMIES T
# And we also want to change the medium parameters:
MEDIUMPARAMS medium.example.dat
