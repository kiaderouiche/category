Since its prediction and experimental discovery, the
Transition Radiation (TR) was thoroughly investigated
and became a usual technique in modern physics experiments.
In most of the cases TR detectors are part of a complicate
geometry setup, which provides not only the particle
identification capability, but the track finding and
measurement tools in a busy environment as well.
