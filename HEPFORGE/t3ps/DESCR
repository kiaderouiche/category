T3PS (Tool for Parallel Processing in Parameter Scans) is
a program for quickly designing and performing parameter
scans while taking advantage of multi-core processors.It
takes a scan definition in a .ini-like file format as input
and based and the parameter ranges and other options contained
therein distributes the calculation of the parameter space
over multiple processes and possibly computers.The derived
data is saved in tabulator separated values format, readable
by most plotting software.The supported scanning strategies
include: grid scan, random scan, Markov Chain Monte Carlo,
numerical optimization
