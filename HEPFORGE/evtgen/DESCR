EvtGen is a Monte Carlo event generator that simulates
the decays of heavy flavour particles, primarily B and
D mesons. It contains a range of decay models for
intermediate and final states containing scalar, vecto
r and tensor mesons or resonances, as well as leptons,
photons and baryons. Decay amplitudes are used to generate
each branch of a given full decay tree, taking into account
angular and time-dependent correlations which allows for
the simulation of CP-violating processes.
