2013-03-19  Andrea Banfi  <banfi@macabanfi-2.local>

	matching to H+1jet@NNLO

2013-01-03  Andrea Banfi  <banfi@macabanfi-2.local>

	* src/mass_corr.f90 (f0b1): used f0b1_chaplin and f0b1_hplog
	according to whether tau is less or larger than one. Only test
	performed is that f0b1 agrees with fig. 5a of hep-ph/0509189

	* Makefile (LDFLAGS): added -lchaplin, assuming it is installed in
	the same directory where hoppet is installed

2012-11-27  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>  + Giulia + Pier

	* src/matching.f90 (fixed_order_schemes):
	  added comments + extra check on size of sigma (it should be
	  consistent with the order being used for Sigmabar array).

	  fixed bug in fixed_order_schemes (scheme a) when length of the
	  sigma array didn't match the number of fixed_orders in
	  sigmabar. (Doesn't change results matched to NNLO).

	* src/jetvheto.f90:
	  extended sigma array to have an extra entry, to be ready for
	  N3LO.

	* scripts/run-checks.pl:
	  added some comments;

2012-10-11  Andrea Banfi  <banfi@macabanfi-2.local>

	* src/matching.f90 (matching): 
	  introduced new fixed order scheme "d" for matching to N^3LO, and
	  modified matching schemes "a" and "b" to work with NLO only.

	* src/jetvheto.f90 (jetvheto): 
	  added fixed_order variable  (1=NLO, 2=NNLO, 3=N3LO), and used it
	  to set the dimensions of the arrays passed to the match and
	  fixed_order_schemes subroutines

2012-08-15  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Pier + Giulia

	* src/matching.f90 (matching_logR): 
	  added comment that logR for NNLL is not tested (and looks erroneous).

2012-08-06  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Andrea + Giulia

	* scripts/tarit.sh:
	  small changes to get correct paths in reminders about tagging
	  and uploads to hepforge.

	* src/jetvheto.f90:
	  now output 3 digits for exponent (solves misformatting problem
	  for very small numbers)

	* scripts/run-checks.pl:
	  reworked tolerances a little; added info about removal of
	  temporary files.

	* scripts/run-checks: *** REMOVED ***
          now obsolete since we have the perl version

2012-08-04  Giulia ZANDERIGHI  <g.zanderighi1@physics.ox.ac.uk> 
	* scripts/run-checks.pl: *** ADDED ***
	* Makefile:
   	  modified make check 

2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch> + Andrea + Giulia

	* src/banner.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  added this even though it's automatically generated, so that if
	  we ever check out and directly make a tarball, it will
	  automatically have all needed files. (So the makefile code just
	  serves to ensure it's up to date).

	* Makefile: 
	  solved issue with compilation of banner.f90

2012-08-03  Andrea BANFI  <ab1040@physik.uni-freiburg.de>

	* scripts/makebanner.pl
	  Script that automatically generates banner.f90. Makefile changed
	  accordingly
	
	* src/jetvheto.f90 (jetvheto): 
	  Used banner.f90 to print out messages for header and help

2012-08-03  Giulia ZANDERIGHI  <g.zanderighi1@physics.ox.ac.uk> 
	* scripts/run-checks: *** ADDED ***
	* Makefile:
   	  added make check 


2012-08-02  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> (later):

	* scripts/tarit.sh: *** ADDED ***
	* Makefile:
	  changed "dist-gzip" to "dist" (as standard).
	  it now runs scripts/tarit.sh, which handles version numbers and
	  gives info about tagging etc. (to be updated once we have
	  hepforge accounts).


2012-08-02  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Andrea + Giulia


	* src/jetvheto.f90:
	  fixed an issue in the normalisation of the resummations, which
	  was being taken at ptmax (the issue is irrelevant if ptmax was
	  large, but led to nonsensical results when it was small).

	  numerous other small changes mostly related to comments and
	  code-readability.

	* src/rad_tools.f90
	* src/emsn_tools.f90
	* src/resummation.f90
	* src/coefficient_functions.f90
	* src/pdfs_tools.f90
	  added various comments, e.g. on action of certain subprograms
	  and provenance of formulas

	* ew_parameters.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  a new file to contain these parameters

	* src/opts_cmdline_cardfile.f90: *** ADDED ***
	* src/reader.f90:
	  sorted out comments + factorised out some code

	* AUTHORS: *** ADDED ***
	* COPYING: *** ADDED ***
	* BUGS:    *** ADDED ***
	  added GPLv3 notice + request to follow MCNet guidelines.

2012-08-01  Andrea Banfi & Giulia Zanderighi
	Second commit: 
	* src/coefficient_functions.f90 
	* src/pdf_tools.f90 	
	renamed module coefficient_functions to coefficient_functions_VH 
	to avoid conflicts with hoppet 
	
	First commit: 
	* src/main_matching.f90 
	  - added error message when no input is specfied for matching 
	  - made NNLL resummation as default (rather than NLL) 
	* src/emsn_tools.f90 
	  - removed all MC calculation of R-dependent terms 
	* src/random.f90 *** DELETED *** 
	* src/rm48.f90 *** DELETED *** 

	* Makefile 
	  - adjusted for changes above 
	  - added option to write module files with ifort 
	  - clean up 
	

2012-07-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>
	
	* Makefile:
	* README: 
	  arranged for these to use hoppet-config and lhapdf-config more
	  directly; adapted README accordingly. Also adapted some
	  dependences etc in view of the changes below

	* src/types.f90:    *** DELETED ***
	* src/consts.f90:   *** DELETED ***
	* src/extra_consts.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  removed two files whose contents are largely provided in
	  hoppet and added an extra one to contain an additional pair of
	  constants. 

	* src/random.f90
	* src/emsn_tools.f90
	  renamed the random module random_rm48, to avoid potentially
	  dangerous conflict with the default hoppet random module.

	* ChangeLog: *** ADDED ***

2012-00-00  Andrea Banfi, Pier Francesco Monni, Gavin Salam,  Giulia Zanderighi:
