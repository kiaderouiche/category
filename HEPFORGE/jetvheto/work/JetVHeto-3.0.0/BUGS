The following is not strictly speaking a bug (rather an artefact), but may look like
one:

At high pt one may observe efficiencies that are larger than 1. There
can be several reasons for this unphysical behaviour:

1) some matching schemes do this (e.g. scheme c), and this is visible 
   even in scheme c fixed-order results

2) the logarithm used currently in JetVHeto does not quite vanish for
   pt > sqrt(s)/2. This leads to artefact for pt's near the kinematic
   limit. This could be straightforwardly by an appropriate
   redefinition of the logarithm.

3) fixed-order results are understood to be using a fixed scale
   muR \simeq muF \sim m_{boson}. This makes no sense at high pt, and
   leads to problems in all matching schemes, and in the pure
   fixed-order results.
