HOPPET: Higher Order Perturbative Parton Evolution Toolkit
----------------------------------------------------------

HOPPET is a Fortran 95 package for carrying out DGLAP evolution and
other common manipulations of parton distribution functions (PDFs).

Within HOPPET, PDFs are represented on a grid in x-space so as to
avoid limitations on the functional form of input
distributions. Decent speed and accuracy are obtained through the
representation of splitting functions in terms of their convolution
with a set of piecewise polynomial basis functions, and Runge-Kutta
techniques are used for the evolution in Q.

Unpolarised evolution is provided in the MSbar scheme to NNLO in the
coupling, including heavy-quark thresholds, and polarised evolution to
NLO. The code is structured so as to provide simple access to the
objects representing splitting function and PDFs, making it possible
for a user to extend the facilities already provided.
