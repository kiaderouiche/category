TemplateTagger is a C++ package for jet substructure analysis
with Template Overlap Method. The code operates with arbitrary
models within ﬁxed-order perturbation theory and arbitrary 
kinematics. Specialized template generation classes allow the
user to implement any model for a decay of a boosted heavy object.
In addition to template overlap, the code provides ability to
calculate other template shape and energy ﬂow observables
