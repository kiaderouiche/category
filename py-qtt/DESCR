# Welcome

Welcome to the QTT framework. This README will shortly introduce the framework, and it will guide you through the structure, installation process and how to contribute. We look forward to working with you!

# Quantum Technology Toolbox

Quantum Technology Toolbox (QTT) is a Python-based framework developed initially by QuTech for the tuning and calibration of
quantum dots and spin qubits. [QuTech](http://qutech.nl) is an advanced research center based in Delft, the Netherlands, for quantum
computing and quantum internet, a collaboration founded by the [University of Technology Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en) (TU Delft) and
the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research ([TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en)).

For usage of QTT see the detailed [documentation](https://qtt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on readthedocs.io.


QTT is the framework on which you can base your measurement and analysis scripts. QTT is based
on [Qcodes](https://github.com/qdev-dk/Qcodes) (basic framework such as instrument drivers, DataSet) and the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem.

## Installation

QTT is compatible with Python 3.5+. QTT can be installed as a pip package to be used in a (virtual) Python environment.
