# pyviz_comms

Offers a simple bidirectional communication architecture between Python and JavaScript, 
with support for Jupyter comms in both the classic notebook and Jupyterlab.
Available for use by any [PyViz](https://pyviz.org) tool, but currently primarily used by
[HoloViz](https://holoviz.org) tools.

There are two installable components in this repository: a Python
component used by various HoloViz tools and an extension to enable
Jupyterlab support.

## Installing the Jupyterlab extension

Jupyterlab users will need to install the Jupyterlab pyviz extension:

```bash
jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
```
