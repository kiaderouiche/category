The qupulse project aims to produce a software toolkit facilitating experiments involving pulse driven state manipulation of physical qubits.

It provides a high-level hardware-independent representation of pulses as well as means to translate this representation to hardware-specific device instructions and waveforms, execute these instructions and perform corresponding measurements.

Pulses can be assembled from previously defined subpulses, allowing easy construction of high-level from low-level pulses and re-use of previous work.
Additionally, all pulses are parameterizable allowing users to fine-tune and adapt pulse templates to specific hardware or functionality without redefining an entire pulse sequence. To ensure meaningful parameter values, constraints can be put on parameters on a per-pulse basis.  

## Status
Note that the project is still in development and thus not feature-complete.

The qupulse library is already used productively by the Quantum Technology Group at the 2nd Institute of Physics at the RWTH Aachen University. As such, some features - such as pulse definition - are mostly complete and tested and interfaces are expected to remain largely stable (or changes to be backward compatible).
However, it is still possible for existing portions of the code base to be redesigned if this will increase the usability long-term.
 
The current feature list is as follows:
