# `pcidb` - the Golang PCI DB library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaypipes/pcidb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaypipes/pcidb)

`pcidb` is a small Golang library for programmatic querying of PCI vendor,
product and class information.

We currently [test](https://travis-ci.org/jaypipes/pcidb/) `pcidb` on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.

## Usage

`pcidb` contains a PCI database inspection and querying facility that allows
developers to query for information about hardware device classes, vendor and
product information.

The `pcidb.New()` function returns a `pcidb.PCIDB` struct or an error if the
PCI database could not be loaded.

> `pcidb`'s default behaviour is to first search for pci-ids DB files on the
> local host system in well-known filesystem paths. If `pcidb` cannot find a
> pci-ids DB file on the local host system, it will then fetch a current
> pci-ids DB file from the network. You can disable this network-fetching
