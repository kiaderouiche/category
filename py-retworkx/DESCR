retworkx is a general purpose graph library for python3 written in Rust to take
advantage of the performance and safety that Rust provides. It was built as a
replacement for qiskit's previous (and current) networkx usage (hence the name)
but is designed to provide a high performance general purpose graph library for
any python application. The project was originally started to build a faster
directed graph to use as the underlying data structure for the DAG at the center
of qiskit-terra's transpiler, but it has since grown to cover all the graph usage
in Qiskit and other applications
