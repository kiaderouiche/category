Samurai is a tool for the automated numerical evaluation
of one-loop virtual corrections to any scattering amplitudes
within the dimensional regularization scheme. It is based on
the decomposition of the integrand according to the OPP-approach,
extended to accommodate an implementation of the generalised
D-dimensional unitarity-cuts technique, and uses a polynomial
interpolation exploiting the Discrete Fourier Transform. Samurai
can process integrands with any number of external legs, written
either as numerator of Feynman diagrams or as product of tree
level amplitudes and it can be compiled in double or quadruple precision.
