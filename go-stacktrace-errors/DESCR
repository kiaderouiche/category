Package errors adds stacktrace support to errors in go.
This is particularly useful when you want to understand
the state of execution when an error was returned unexpectedly.
It provides the type \*Error which implements the standard
golang error interface, so you can use this library
interchangably with code that is expecting a normal error return.
