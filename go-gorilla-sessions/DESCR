gorilla/sessions provides cookie and filesystem sessions and infrastructure for
custom session backends.

The key features are:

- Simple API: use it as an easy way to set signed (and optionally
  encrypted) cookies.
- Built-in backends to store sessions in cookies or the filesystem.
- Flash messages: session values that last until read.
- Convenient way to switch session persistency (aka "remember me") and set
  other attributes.
- Mechanism to rotate authentication and encryption keys.
- Multiple sessions per request, even using different backends.
- Interfaces and infrastructure for custom session backends: sessions from
  different stores can be retrieved and batch-saved using a common API.
