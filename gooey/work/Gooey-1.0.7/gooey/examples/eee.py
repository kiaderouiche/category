Guess again. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Bender?! You stole the atom. Noooooo! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Ooh, name it after me! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Ooh, name it after me! We don't have a brig. I had more, but you go ahead.

Say it in Russian! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Bite my shiny metal ass. Yeah, lots of people did.
