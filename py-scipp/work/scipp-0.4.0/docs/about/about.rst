References and citations
------------------------

An article about scipp has been published in the conference proceedings of ICANS, see `Scipp: Scientific data handling with labeled multi-dimensional arrays for C++ and Python <https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-neutron-research/jnr190131>`_ .

A significant amount of changes such as multi-threading and support for realigned (event) data has gone into scipp since the publication so we recommend to also cite the scipp documentation pages.
