INTRODUCTION
------------
The most recent version of this program can be obtained from: 
https://blackhawk.hepforge.org/

This C code (in C99 standard) provides a detailed computation of the Hawking emission spectrum
for any mass and spin distribution of Kerr Black Holes.

The program has been tested on Linux, Mac and Windows (using Cygwin) machines with gcc, clang and icc.

If you use BlackHawk to write a paper, please cite:

as well as PYTHIA or HERWIG depending on the choice of hadronization code.
