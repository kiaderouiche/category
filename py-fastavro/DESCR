Because the Apache Python `avro` package is written in pure Python, it is
relatively slow. In one test case, it takes about 14 seconds to iterate through
a file of 10,000 records. By comparison, the JAVA `avro` SDK reads the same file in
1.9 seconds.

The `fastavro` library was written to offer performance comparable to the Java
library. With regular CPython, `fastavro` uses C extensions which allow it to
iterate the same 10,000 record file in 1.7 seconds. With PyPy, this drops to 1.5
seconds (to be fair, the JAVA benchmark is doing some extra JSON
encoding/decoding).

`fastavro` supports the following Python versions:

* Python 3.5
