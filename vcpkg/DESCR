# Vcpkg: Overview
[‰∏≠ÊñáÊÄªËßà](README_zh_CN.md)

Vcpkg helps you manage C and C++ libraries on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
This tool and ecosystem are constantly evolving, and we always appreciate contributions!

If you've never used vcpkg before, or if you're trying to figure out how to use vcpkg,
check out our [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for how to start using vcpkg.

For short description of available commands, once you've installed vcpkg,
you can run `vcpkg help`, or `vcpkg help [command]` for command-specific help.
